The phrase \"i should go to sleep but i m feeling reluctant to let go of the day\" expresses an emotional conflict. The individual acknowledges the need to sleep, but also expresses a reluctance towards relinquishing their current experience, which could imply a feeling of sadness or difficulty in letting go.\n\nNow, we compare this to the labeled examples:\n\n- Examples with a **True** label generally reflect feelings of resentment, irritation, or any form of emotional conflict or negative sentiment.\n- Examples with a **False** label often indicate an absence of strong emotional feelings or a sense of acceptance regarding a situation.\n\nSince data21 indicates a negative emotional state (reluctance to let go, which signifies emotional attachment or conflict), it aligns more closely with the examples labeled **True**.\n\nThus, the classification for data21 is:\n\n<response>true</response>", "true_label": false, "normalized_response": true, "is_correct": false, "rule_articulation": "The labeling rule can be deduced from the provided examples. Here\u2019s how we can break it down:\n\n1. **Presence of Emotional Expression**: The statements that are labeled as \"True\" often reflect feelings of negativity, discomfort, or emotional responses such as resentment, jealousy, irritation, or feeling attacked. These expressions show a reaction to a situation that has caused some emotional turmoil.\n\n2. **Neutral or Positive Feelings**: Statements labeled as \"False\" generally convey a sense of calmness, acceptance, or lack of emotional disturbance. They either imply a neutral state or highlight that the person is not feeling negative emotions about a situation.\n\n3. **Self-Reflection**: Statements that involve personal reflection or acknowledgment of emotions (\u201cI feel,\u201d \u201cI realize,\u201d \u201cI know\u201d) seem to be more likely to be labeled as \"True\" when they lead to negative or complex feelings, while they are likely labeled as \"False\" when discussing acceptance, or lack of strong feelings.\n\n4. **Context of the Experience**: The context often plays a role where negative or challenging circumstances lead to emotional feelings. The stronger the negative sentiment portrayed in the statement, the more likely it is to be labeled \"True\".\n\nIn summary, the labeling rule appears to classify statements primarily based on whether they express negative emotions or reactions (True) versus neutral or positive states (False).

These sentences convey a strong sense of an emotional state, often involving frustration or other negative feelings.\n\n   - Examples:\n     - \"i walk away feeling dissatisfied like i ve waited for my caffeine hit only to get a decaf\" (anger/disappointment)\n     - \"i kept feeling enraged that she was in too\" (anger)\n     - \"i bet you are feeling really mad and hurt\" (anger)\n     - \"i begin to feel terribly rude and that causes me to become depressed\" (guilt/depression)\n     - \"i am feeling so grumpy today\" (grumpiness)\n\n2. **False Labels**: The sentences classified as \"False\" tend to express uncertainty, indecisiveness, apprehension, or non-emotional observations. They may mention feelings but do not showcase strong emotional responses that are clearly felt, or they suggest a neutral or somewhat passive emotional state.\n\n   - Examples:\n     - \"im not completely sure my topic is narrow enough and im feeling apprehensive about being able to find half of my sources in print\" (uncertainty)\n     - \"i went into the movie i was feeling skeptical and slightly nervous that i was going to be disappointed\" (nervousness without intensity)\n     - \"i have found a no of people raising this issue but then i have not yet come across any officials addressing the same i am just feeling helpless\" (helplessness without strong emotional flair)\n   \nIn summary, the classification is mainly about the intensity and clarity of the emotions expressed in the statements. Statements that convey stronger feelings of anger, frustration, or similar intense emotions are labeled \"True,\" whereas those that express uncertainty or less intense feelings fall into the \"False\" category.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i had horrible anxiety dreams every night last week and it made me feel really paranoid and of course all of that reading about conspiracy theories and unsolved crimes online didnt hugely help matters\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i feel really petty at the moment because i am extremely angry because im broke at the moment and it sort of pisses me off\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i men zhu said is snapbacks cheap i also feel here too dangerous at present for the sake of under the door of safety since see or leave this green lotus temple first wholesale obey snapback hats\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: im down to blogging again simply because im feeling very distracted though im suppose to study cell bio now\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i have never made the first step because the guys were alway faster this is why this situation is making me feel very unsure and elusively shy\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: im feeling cranky and horrible\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i feel tortured because i am not allowed to enjoy food the way my friend can\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i feel so because i feel reluctant\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i was half feeling very irritated and just wanted to get out of a amp f lol\nlabel9: True\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i feel like the helpless duckie target for the commies and feds while at other times i want to run and hide\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i feel that spitting on somebody is the most vicious kind of disrespect that you can do he said\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel like we are pressured into being young beautiful thin and depending on the trend having the girls rejuvenated or butt implants\nlabel12: False\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i feel assaulted when i hear the radio ad\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i am feeling spiteful\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i feel like all women are witches in someway why do we have to be tortured for being beautiful and powerful\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: im just feeling seriously pissed off at myself for doing something fantabulous but utterly stupid\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i rarely feel hesitant to say something sometimes even too much\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i dont hate you i just honestly feel so bitter towards you atm\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i met them great people but i have a feeling i may have unintentionally offended them\nlabel19: True\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i was incredibly youthful in my employment in which i had been angry stay when i was feeling i had been offended simply because i wasnt the professional decided on\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: i know that i still feel kind of agitated but i also switch from feeling hot to feeling cold when i lay down\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify data21, we should first analyze the text for emotional content or feelings being expressed. \n\nIn data21, the individual states that they \"feel kind of agitated\" and mentions switching from feeling hot to feeling cold.

Examples include expressing feelings of jealousy, offense, compassion, or uncertainty.\n\n2. **Neutral or Indirect Emotional Expression**: Statements that don't convey a strong personal emotional experience or are more factual in nature are labeled as `False`. This includes feelings of pressure, insecurity, or uncertainty that are not deeply personal or emphatic.\n\n3. **Vulnerability**: Statements that convey a sense of vulnerability or hesitation (but are clearly focused on emotions) tend to be classified as `True`, while those that reference emotions in a way that does not fully engage the speaker's feelings can be classified as `False`.\n\n4. **Complex Emotional Reflection**: Statements that indicate a deeper reflection on one's feelings or emotional struggles are also likely to be labeled as `True` (e.g., understanding the source of someone else's harmful behavior).\n\nIn summary, the rule appears to be that if the data expresses a strong, personal emotional sentiment or an explicit emotional experience, it is labeled `True`. If the data is more about factual information, vague feelings, or lacks a substantive emotional connection, it is labeled `False`. \n\nThus, the final rule can be summarized as:\n**Label as `True` if the statement expresses a strong, personal emotion or feeling; label as `False` if it does not convey such emotional depth.**", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i keep feeling weird sensations img src http s\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: ive been feeling distressed\nlabel2: False\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i even mentioned him was to show i want to trust you with my feelings hoping you would not think i was being rude mean coercive or pushy\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel fucked\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: im feeling a bit suspicious\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: ive had my ass handed to me by murt and im starting to feel fucked but just a little\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i feel insulted video pete edochie responds to death hoax i feel insulted a href http olajideolafunmbi\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: ill write a bunch youll respond and then ill back off in part because i feel shy\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i am suddenly feeling insulted while typing this down\nlabel9: True\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i cant really understand my feeling cause its a mixture between bitter and a sour one which even i dont get\nlabel10: True\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i have a reminder of the joy and peace i feel in his arms i am tortured\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel cold few days\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: im feeling so pissed off now\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i worry that he s feeling resentful for doing woman s work\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i sing the more confident i feel but i still get a little nervous on an opening night\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i often feel resentful of anything that seems good\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i see women wearing boots i feel envious that i want to curse them\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i feel i was intimidated by the college and people at home\nlabel18: False\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i feel reluctant in applying there because i want to be able to find a company where i know at least one person\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i feel the skeptical looks and eye rolls when we say we need a bigger house after all we re dinks double income no kids which is prettymuch the most awesome acronym ever\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: im feeling terrified no control and now my world is shaking the curtains close and it tingles and tickles inside in my pulse\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine the label for data21, we should analyze the text and compare it with the examples provided.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Expression of Emotion**: The sentence \"im feeling terrified\" expresses a strong emotional state, specifically fear, which aligns with many examples that exhibit clear emotional distress or intense feelings. \n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: The continuation of the sentence with phrases like \"no control\" and \"my world is shaking\" suggests a heightened state of anxiety or distress. Such phrases indicate that this individual is not just feeling a slight discomfort, but an overwhelming sense of fear and loss of control.\n\n3. **Comparison with Examples**: Looking at previous examples, many instances labeled as True involve strong emotional expressions (e.g., \"i feel fucked\", \"i feel insulted\", \"i am suddenly feeling insulted\"). The presence of intense emotions or distress signifies that the statement likely fits within the True classification.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the expression reflects a strong emotional state of fear and distress, the rule observed in previous examples suggests that statements that express intense feelings (whether they are positive or negative) are generally classified as True.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude:\n\n<response>true</response>", "true_label": false, "normalized_response": true, "is_correct": false, "rule_articulation": "The data provided can be classified based on whether the statements communicate a strong or explicit emotional feeling (label: True) or a more neutral, ambiguous, or weak emotional expression (label: False). \n\nHere's the breakdown of the rule:\n\n1. **Strong Emotional Expression (True)**: The statements that indicate a clear, strong, or intense emotion such as anger, resentment, feeling insulted, tortured, or any strong unfavorable feelings.

Expressions like \"I feel bashful\" or \"I feel hesitant\" denote less intense emotional experiences.\n\n4. **Complex Emotional Expressions**:\n   - Statements that convey dissatisfaction or a struggle with feelings (e.g., wanting to be open but fearing reactions) seem to lead to a \"False\" label, as they show uncertainty rather than strong emotion.\n\n5. **Context Matters**:\n   - The context of the feeling matters too.

Labeling Criteria:\n   - **False Labels**: Generally apply to statements where feelings are relatively mild, confused, or do not indicate intense emotional struggle (e.g., feeling doubtful, intimidated, overwhelmed without context, reluctant, shaky).\n   - **True Labels**: More likely apply to statements that indicate a stronger emotional conflict or intense feelings, even if these feelings are negative (e.g., feeling tortured, vicious, greedy, vulnerable, jealous, or disgusted). \n\nThus, the final answer for the rule could be summarized as:\n\n**Rule:** Text classified as \"True\" contains emotionally intense or conflicted feelings while \"False\" describes mild emotional states or confusion without significant emotional depth.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i am feeling very unsure of my future\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: ill admit to feeling a little paranoid and wondering about how many others had defriended me\nlabel2: False\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i feel so extrememly bitchy today that ive done something i have never done in my years of life\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i surmise that after i have made myself sick one too many times on take out and sitcom re runs that i will come around again into feeling dissatisfied with a stationary life without much forward motion\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i don t want to cry either because i know she ll think i feel tortured having to eat the black part of the rice\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i feel that cold breeze\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i feel afraid i hold tighter to my faith and i live one more day and i make it through the rain\nlabel7: False\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: im not feeling pissed off about picking up those toys\nlabel8: True\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i feel very dissatisfied with myself\nlabel9: True\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: im off to the big city solo for what im afraid is going to be six days of wandering around lost six days of feeling uncomfortable six days of not knowing how to dress six days of not knowing what to do six days of not knowing where to eat six days of disaster disaster disaster\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i frantically try to get it done and now feel frantic as i walk in the studio\nlabel11: False\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel that i want what i need and know that i just need to bleed in this fucked up world of my own\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i feel resentful that it hurts so much but i m also grateful she said for what i can do including disco swimming and even taking the stairs\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i couldnt help but feel totally distraught and utterly helpless when lorena was kidnapped and tortured almost to death by a band of enemies i was desperate for her freedom\nlabel14: False\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: im feeling more vulnerable writing about this than i do writing about my melt downs mishaps and toddler challenges\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i suppose if one were to love someone one would feel doubtful\nlabel16: False\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i also hate feeling aggravated when i dont know how i am supposed to eat because when i feel that way i often sound that way\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: im feeling really quite angry\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i woke up today feeling pissed off\nlabel19: True\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i can t help feeling jealous\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: i feel that she should change herself and i was too timid to speak up for her except in underground murmurs\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify data21, we need to identify the underlying rule used for the classification of the previous examples. \n\nLooking through the examples, we can observe that the statements labeled as True typically convey a strong emotional or subjective feeling, often involving clear expressions of emotions such as anger, jealousy, dissatisfaction, and various vulnerabilities.

For example, expressions of mixed feelings (e.g., \"contentedly terrified\") or less intense feelings of fear, doubt, or skepticism that do not highlight strong emotional turmoil result in a \"False\" label.\n\nIn summary, the classification rule can be articulated as follows: \n- Assign \"True\" for sentences displaying strong negative emotions or distress.\n- Assign \"False\" for sentences that do not convey strong emotional turmoil or that express more neutral feelings.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i would also feel threatened by the ease with which private information could permeate the system\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i want to wimp out on feeling outraged\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i am supposed to feel doubtful but i still think i forget sometimes how amazing it is that i am living in this city and that i get to work with such inspiring young women at my internship\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i loathe stuffed animals they make me feel a bit violent and i have been known to punch them\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i get another call from a frantic junior for my file and i obviously refused ta help her and now im feeling like i was too rude i mean i jz went like yeah sorry i just dont do that\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i feel like popping them in the face with my fist because they re obnoxious\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i didnt feel the cold up there because we had a fire every night\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i didnt tell you because i didnt want you to feel afraid\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i continue to feel nervous inside and long to talk sensibly even just one time around someone its so wrong to have these feelings for on so many levels i have no clue\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i feel truly impatient that this is taking so long\nlabel10: True\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i sort of feel a bit unsure now as to what to touch upon next\nlabel11: False\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel frustrated or impatient\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i feel a bit uncertain really shes a nice girl and good friend material\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i didn t feel like she was shy so much as taking it all in as her mother has described her\nlabel14: False\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i feel bitchy because i am hurting too\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i started feeling reluctant to go because i wanted to spend some time with my family before i left\nlabel16: False\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: im still feeling a little hesitant but plunging in with a multitude of colored pencils nonetheless\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i mean weve been friends for a long time and these things are not new to me but right now it feels like all i ever want to do is just roll my eyes at everything you say and tell you how obnoxious youre being\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i feel so tortured\nlabel19: True\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i feel anxious about a coming event or activity that will require physical energy that i may not have or emotional events that will require emotional energy i look to my parent and adult to take charge\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: i feel incredibly slacking mrs greedy guts is still in desperate search for an unspoilt base on her career ladder\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify the given data, we'll analyze the content of the statement in data21. \n\nUpon examining the phrase \"i feel incredibly slacking\", it suggests a personal feeling of inadequacy or laziness, which aligns with expressing negative internal emotions or frustrations about oneself. \n\nThe rule that has been consistently applied in the examples is that statements expressing strong emotions, particularly negative ones, tend to get a \"True\" label, whereas more neutral or less intense emotional statements receive a \"False\" label.\n\nIn this case, \"i feel incredibly slacking\" conveys a negative emotion related to a feeling of underperformance or dissatisfaction.

For example, feelings of vulnerability, jealousy, anger, and doubt are involved in the `True` labels.\n\n3. **Absence of Positive Resolution**: Many statements labeled as `False` include descriptions of situations where the speaker expresses comfort or absence of fear, or whose emotional state does not suggest distress, such as feeling part of a family of the universe or being in control of headaches.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Emotion Exploration**: The `True` labels often cover a broader and deeper exploration of emotions that can impact one's well-being, whereas the `False` entries are either observations or feelings that don't suggest significant distress.\n\n5. **Judgment of Complexity in Emotions**: Statements that illustrate complexity in emotions\u2014combining fear and vulnerability or frustration\u2014tend to lead to a `True` classification.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The rule used for classification categorizes statements with negative or distressing emotional undertones as `True`, while those devoid of significant negativity or that imply comfort or neutrality are categorized as `False`.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i feel really wronged in fact what hu jia did is good for society\nlabel1: True\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i just feel so unsure of myself and everything in my life\nlabel2: False\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i do at times feel a bit strange with my mom ushering her about as though shes her traumatic brain injury is really doing a toll on her mental and physical capacities\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel extremely insulted\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i am beginning to feel startled by how little of last week i remember\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i can remember a year ago yesterday feeling so unsure so scared of what our future held\nlabel6: False\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i went back to work feeling agitated and lazy which transformed into this state where i just yelled i dont know\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i got caught shoplifting a package of gummy bears\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i found myself feeling inhibited and shushing her quite a lot\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: staying in a relatives house which was broken in before\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i remember feeling annoyed but also wondering if i shouldn t stop and buy something\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i was a child i stole rmb from my grandfather maternal and i feel i exceptionally wronged him\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i also feel fearful and concerned for them both worried\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i feel mad sad and discouraged there is something so marvelous about the lord jesus something about the holy word of god that ignites my soul with hope to once again keep moving forward\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i feel unsure or neutral about changing but really does not want to change\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i feel angry im happy\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: ill smoke a few cigarettes because im feeling a little nervous\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: im feeling easily irritable lately too\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i love how i can feel totally distressed and hopeless but when i put on a bright eyes record or something all of a sudden i have this realization that there is more to life than the shit i worry about\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i only cry when i think how guilty youll make me feel and yes ive fucked up a million reasons for shame and im sorry\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: ive just watched the above video for the first time and feel a bit bitchy for doing so but here are some of my thoughts on her outfits\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify data21, we need to identify whether it expresses a strong emotional sentiment\u2014particularly negative feelings such as feeling wronged, insulted, or guilty. \n\nThe sentence \"ive just watched the above video for the first time and feel a bit bitchy for doing so but here are some of my thoughts on her outfits\" suggests that the speaker is reflecting on their feelings after watching a video but does not present a clear expression of deep negative emotions like anger, insult, or guilt.

The beginning of data21 states \"i feel that he s really shy with his feelings.\" This is an observation about someone else's feelings.\n2. It continues with, \"because as he talked about how he felt what happened during the trip he was really nervous.\" This adds context about the individual's feelings but remains outside the speaker's direct emotional expression.\n3. Finally, it includes \"and i appreciate the effort to say all of that by the way,\" which reflects a supportive sentiment but does not express a strong emotional experience from the speaker.\n\nThe statement focuses more on another person's feelings and nervousness rather than directly expressing the speaker's own deep emotional state.\n\nGiven this analysis, data21 does not meet the criteria established for \"True\" labels, as it does not express a strong or significant emotional experience from the speaker themselves.\n\nTherefore, the classification is:\n\n<response>false</response>", "true_label": false, "normalized_response": false, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The rule used to classify the data appears to be based on the presence of certain emotional or psychological states being expressed in the sentences.

of conflict, such as feeling guilt, frustration, or intense feelings about a particular situation (e.g., Example 1, experiencing nervousness and excitement).\n\n3. **Neutral or Positive Sentiments**: Conversely, the examples that are labeled \"False\" tend to express more neutral sentiments or describe situations without an emotional charge, such as a general state of being or mild feelings of

emotional impact (like feeling \"hateful,\" \"restless,\" \"overwhelmed,\" and \"burnt out\"), aligning with the \"True\" classification. \n\n5. **Absence of Strong Emotion**: Examples without strong

If the emotional state indicated is less severe or reflects a more normal, everyday feeling (like feeling a little off, or uncertain without distress), it would not be classified as \"True.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the rule seems to be:\n- **Label as \"True\"**: If the statement reflects strong negative emotions or feelings of distress.\n- **Label as \"False\"**: If the statements reflect neutral feelings, general discomfort, or mild stress without strong emotional undertones. \n\nHence, the final answer for the rule is to distinguish between the intensity of emotions expressed, categorizing clear expressions of negative emotions as \"True\" and more muted or neutral sentiments as \"False.\"", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i just remember feeling so much pain and being confused and scared and convinced that i could not do this\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i get home i laze around in my pajamas feeling grouchy\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i dunno the word im even looking for i guess because im not exactly how i feel im selfish i know\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel completely shaken up\nlabel4: False\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i have admitted defeat and asked the other half to come back from the lake coz i just feel so uptight already\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: im feeling a bit scared to consider putting myself out there by posting my work on a website frequented by professional artists but i decided to suck it up be a big girl and ask for feedback\nlabel6: False\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: im feeling cranky\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: in the army\nlabel8: True\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i specifically wanted tango was feeling shy and maks quite the opposite hard to get far enough away from him to get good pics lol\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i feel like im being taken advantage of and on top of that i am really bothered by my boyfriends sloppy behaviors\nlabel10: True\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i feel like im not as stubborn\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i did feel unsure about it but thanks to l a lot of people liked it\nlabel12: False\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i feel tortured by this thought but it feels so true\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i think they feel somehow offended because the christians played a big part in destroying the earlier cultures religions and mythologies\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i feel like i need to make a list leanne would be appalled at the thought so that i dont miss anything\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i feel shaken or angry that my husband keeps lying to me and is a sexaholic i often start to feel mad at god\nlabel16: False\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i like to buck the system and climb on my soapbox when i feel wronged or see others wronged but for the most part i am more comfortable with a society that accepts certain behaviors as moral truths\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: im feeling hesitant to put much else into words\nlabel18: False\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i really dont like attention because i feel pressured to think about a topic and talk\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i proclaim to have lost a bit of my sanity and feel so shaky\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: i feel kind of strange\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify the statement \"i feel kind of strange,\" we must determine if it aligns with the examples given. \n\nThe key points to analyze:\n\n1.

used for classification in the examples provided, let's analyze the data and their corresponding labels step by step.\n\n1. **Identifying Emotion Expressions**:\n   - The phrases labeled as **True** tend to express stronger emotions or feelings, particularly negative feelings such as fear, anxiety, irritation, hostility, and being overwhelmed.\n   - Conversely, phrases labeled as **False** generally describe emotions or feelings that are milder or more neutral, often indicating a lack of strong emotional intensity or a more observational tone.\n\n2. **Emotional Context**:\n   - **True Labels**:\n     - They reflect intense feelings, whether positive or negative, including feeling bad about a situation, feeling haunted by memories, or expressing a strong personal sentiment.\n     - Examples: \"I feel rediculous and petty,\" \"I feel a violent tug at my eye socket,\" \"I feel strange out of sorts.\"\n   - **False Labels**:\n     - These often describe feelings where there's no strong emotional impact or where the individual seems to rationalize or remain unaffected by their feelings.\n     - Examples: \"I feel anxious,\" \"I feel uncomfortable,\" \"I can understand.\"\n\n3. **Overall Sentiment**:\n   - The examples show that **True** generally signifies stronger, more visceral reactions, while **False** indicates feelings that are either subdued or indicate a reflective, less emotionally charged state.\n\n**Final Rule**: The classification rule seems to be that a data entry is labeled as **True** if it expresses a strong, intense emotion or reaction, while it is

Here\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Presence of Negative Emotions**: When the statements explicitly express feelings of negative emotions like anger, insecurity, feeling overwhelmed, feeling shy, or feelings of inadequacy, they tend to receive the label \"True\". For example:\n   - Example 3: \"i feel angry\" (True)\n   - Example 7: \"feeling envious\" (True)\n   - Example 9: \"kinda appalled\" (True)\n   - Example 13: \"feeling rebellious\" (True)\n\n2. **Neutral or Positive Context**: Statements that convey a more neutral or positive context, or that do not strongly express negative feelings, tend to receive the label \"False\".

However, it doesn't strongly imply feelings of despair, hatred, or being overwhelmed in comparison to other examples marked \"True.\"\n4. The act of setting a timer to write suggests a proactive approach to overcoming that reluctance rather than being consumed by a negative feeling.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentiment doesn't strongly equate to \"True\" as previously defined.
