The first step involves identifying whether the statement presents a significant, factual revelation or update on an event or situation (which tends to be labeled \"True\") or whether it simply includes general information or a less impactful occurrence (which tends to be labeled \"False\").\n\n2. In data21, we see that it discusses Hal Sutton's decision in selecting a U.S. team for the Ryder Cup, indicating that this is a development in a sports context. The mention of a \"good idea\" implies some planning or strategy based on the results of a championship, which suggests this is a notable update rather than merely generic information.\n\n3. Comparatively, in previous examples, significant decisions and updates (especially in sports contexts) tend to be classified as \"True.\"\n\nTaking these observations into account, data21 embodies a factual update regarding the Ryder Cup team composition. Therefore, it fits the criterion for classification.\n\nSo, the response is:\n\n<response>true</response>", "true_label": true, "normalized_response": true, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The rule used to classify the data is based on whether the content of the text conveys factual, specific information that can be verified as true or false. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning for determining whether a label is \"True\" or \"False\":\n\n1. **Analysis of Content**: Evaluate the information provided in the text. Is it a factual statement, a report on an event, or a declaration based on evidence?\n\n2. **Verification**: Consider if the statement could be verified through external sources. True labels correlate with statements that can be substantiated and are factually accurate.\n\n3. **Type of Information**:\n   - Texts that report on companies, scientific facts, or significant events tend to be labeled \"True\" if they provide verifiable details.\n   - Conversely, statements that express opinions, predictions, or unverifiable information tend to be labeled \"False.\"\n\n4. **Context**: Assessing the context is crucial. For instance, a business decision or financial report that is verifiable and discusses concrete data is likely \"True.\" However, a narrative that speculates or discusses hypothetical situations may lead to a \"False\" label.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Finally, the text is categorized based on whether it can present verifiable information (True) or whether it fails to provide evidence and instead presents hypothetical, unclear, or opinion-based content (False).\n\nIn summary, the rule is that texts labeled \"True\" present verifiable and factual information, while those labeled \"False\" do not provide sufficient evidence for verification or present unverifiable claims.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: LIVERMORE: NO NEED FOR HP-UX ON X86 CHICAGO -- THIS CANNOT BE AN EASY TIME FOR ANN LIVERMORE.

On the other hand, texts that do not provide substantial information or appear more trivial or promotional in nature tend to be labeled as false.\n\nIn this case, the mention of an alert prompted by an unidentified substance at a diplomatic location falls into a category that can be considered significant and newsworthy, reflecting a situation that carries implications for public safety.

The use of the adjective \"dramatic\" and the word \"controversial\" suggests that it was a notable event in sports.\n\nSince this data describes a significant and factual event in sports history, it aligns with the label assignment criteria found in the previous examples that identified such news accurately.\n\nThus, we can conclude:\n\n<response>true</response>", "true_label": true, "normalized_response": true, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The classification rule used to determine the labels (True or False) for the provided examples is as follows:\n\n1. **Assess the Content of the Statement**:\n   - Determine if the content presents a clear fact, event, or statement that can be classified as true or false based on general knowledge or logical reasoning.\n\n2. **True Statements**:\n   - Statements that report factual information about events, scientific discoveries, historical facts, or confirmed occurrences.

They often describe specific actions, events, or statements made by individuals or organizations, along with their contexts.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Nature of Statements**: The \"True\" labels often relate to positive developments, meaningful discussions, or factual descriptions (like financial reports, political events, etc.). Conversely, \"False\" labels often involve vague descriptions, superficial commentary, or lack of substantive information.\n\n3. **Evaluating Outcomes or Impact**: Statements that illustrate or imply an outcome resulting from an action tend to be labeled \"True.\" For example, financial gains, political events, significant societal actions, or phenomena that have tangible implications.\n\n4. **Identifying Exceptions**: Some statements that may seem informative still get a \"False\" label due to their lack of substantial newsworthiness or clear relevance. For instance, speculative discussions on security or personal experiences without broader implications may lean towards being classified as \"False.\"\n\nIn summary, the rule can be seen as follows: A statement is labeled \"True\" if it conveys clear, meaningful, and verifiable information about significant events, outcomes, or developments. If the statement is vague, superficial, or lacks significance, it is labeled \"False.\"", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: LAST CALL FOR INVESTORS TO BID ON GOOGLE (REUTERS) REUTERS -

For \"True\" labels, the statements describe events or information that can be corroborated or commonly accepted as correct.\n\n2. **Content Evaluation**: \n   - True statements generally convey factual occurrences or widely acknowledged information relating to recent events or established knowledge.\n   - False statements often involve misinterpretations, misleading contexts, or situations that don't reflect actual events or outcomes.\n\n3. **Context Consideration**: The broader context or implications of the statements are also considered. True labels often relate to definitive actions (like events, agreements, or factual announcements), while false labels include vague claims, predictions, or non-verifiable statements.\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - Example 2 discusses a legal finding regarding Michael Jackson, which aligns with factual news, thus labeled \"True.\"\n   - Example 19 refers to terrorist suspects being charged, which involves a specific legal context but is marked as \"False,\" likely indicating a misunderstanding related to the violent nature or implications of the mention.\n\n5. **Subjective Elements**: Some examples with subjective statements or implications are labeled \"True,\" showcasing a need for clarity on what constitutes shared understanding versus personal or speculative interpretations.\n\nFinal Rule:\nThe classification rule seems to determine whether the statement presents an accurate representation of facts, events, or widely recognized information (True) versus statements that may be misleading, speculative, or incorrect (False).", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: RULING BARS EDWARDS FROM ATHENS COMPETITION ATHENS, GREECE -- US SPRINTER TORRI EDWARDS #39; SUSPENSION WAS UPHELD BY A PANEL OF THREE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATORS TUESDAY, LEAVING THE REIGNING 100-METER WORLD CHAMPION UNABLE TO COMPETE AT THE OLYMPICS. \nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: wireless net to get speed boost wireless computer networks could soon be running 10 times faster than they do now.\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: ginobili gives argentina big lift at the buzzer manu ginobili's off-balance shot left his hand just a split-second before the final buzzer, dropping through the basket to give argentina an 83-82 victory over serbia-montenegro yesterday on the first day of olympic men's basketball in athens.\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: nadal wins in poland for first atp title (ap) ap - spain's rafael nadal won his first atp singles title sunday, beating argentina's jose acasuso 6-3, 6-4 in the final at the idea prokom open.\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: tv: iraqi kidnappers of iran envoy want pows freed  tehran (reuters) - kidnappers holding an iranian diplomat  in iraq will \"punish\" him within 48 hours if iran does not  release 500 prisoners captured in its 1980-1988 war with iraq,  iranian state television said sunday.\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: al wrap: olerud cheers yankees by sinking ex-team  new york (reuters) - john olerud sunk his former team by  recording a two-run single in the eighth inning to drive in the  go-ahead runs which earned the new york yankees a 6-4 win over  the host seattle mariners in the american league saturday.   \nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: MOLIK JOINS PRATT IN LAST 16 ALICIA MOLIK JOINED FELLOW AUSTRALIAN NICOLE PRATT IN THE LAST 16 OF THE OLYMPIC TENNIS COMPETITION OVERNIGHT WITH A 7-5 6-4 SECOND ROUND WIN OVER SLOVENIA #39;S KATARINA SREBOTNIK. \nlabel7: False\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: HURRICANE EMERGENCY AID SET UP IN FLORIDA (AP) AP - MORE THAN 76,000 MEALS AND SNACKS HAVE BEEN SERVED TO HURRICANE-RAVAGED COUNTIES IN FLORIDA, WITH THOUSANDS MORE AVAILABLE FROM FEDERAL, LOCAL AND PRIVATE AGENCIES, THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY SAID MONDAY.\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: biased against whom?

For example, a mention of sports events with clear outcomes, results from scientific studies, or reports on incidents (like a bomb explosion) convey facts that can be checked against external sources.\n\n2. **False Labels**: The statements labeled as \"False\" often imply predictions, opinions, or statements that can be subjective and cannot be definitively substantiated.

They may also depict scenarios without clear factual backing.\n\n3. **Overall Pattern**: The classification appears to be focused on concrete events and verifiable outcomes rather than ambiguous predictions or speculative statements. \n\n4. **Conclusion**: The rule can thus be summarized as follows:\n   - **Label as True** if the statement presents verifiable, factual information about real events or outcomes.\n   - **Label as False** if the statement involves predictions, opinions, or unverifiable claims.\n\nThis rule ensures that the classification is consistent with the presence of factual content versus speculative or unverifiable assertions.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: infocus: examining a public exploit, part 1 the purpose of this article is to analyze a public exploit in a lab environment, see the alerts generated by an intrusion detection system, and then do some packet analysis of the malicious binary in order to better understand it.\nlabel1: True\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: CHINA #39;S APPEAL TO NORTH KOREA: ATTEND NUCLEAR WORKING TALKS CHINA HAS ASKED THAT NORTH KOREA ATTEND WORKING-LEVEL MEETINGS AHEAD OF THE NEXT ROUND OF SIX-PARTY NUCLEAR TALKS IN BEIJING. \nlabel2: False\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: cost cuts help kmart post profit  chicago (reuters) - kmart holding corp. &lt;kmrt.o&gt; on monday  reported its third consecutive quarterly profit as cost cuts  made up for slumping sales, and its cash pile grew to about  \\$2.6 billion.\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: o's beat blue jays with eight-run eighth (ap) ap - david newhan tied a career high with four hits, including a go-ahead double in baltimore's eight-run eighth inning, and the orioles rallied for an 11-7 victory over the toronto blue jays on sunday.\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: A LOOK AT U.S. MILITARY DEATHS IN IRAQ (AP) AP - AS OF MONDAY, AUG. 16, 935 U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS HAVE DIED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MILITARY OPERATIONS IN IRAQ IN MARCH 2003, ACCORDING TO THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT.
