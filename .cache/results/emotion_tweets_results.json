They might not overtly express positivity or negativity but lean more toward frustration or complexity in emotions, leading to a \"False\" classification:\n   - \"I think you give permission to your kids to feel like they've been terribly wronged\" (Example 15 - False)\n   - \"I felt it when a girl who was dear to me lied to my face\" (Example 17 - False)\n\n4. **Empathy or Understanding**: Statements that reflect empathy, understanding, or a desire for compassion in relationships tend to receive a \"True\" label:\n   - \"I feel like sometimes if people were a bit more compassionate...\" (Example 19 - True)\n\nIn summary, the labeling rule hinges on the emotional tone of the statement: positive sentiments lead to \"True,\" while negative or conflicted feelings lead to \"False.\"", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: there is a girl at my work that doesnt take care much of her hygiene she comes always with her hair oiled\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i wasnt the only one who didnt care for javert in signatures les miserables as he was the only major male role who didnt get a nom valjean got an undeserved i feel nod in the lead category while thenardier enjolras and my boy marius got supporting nods\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i feel vile for actually caring about you\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel naughty bear would have been priced appropriately at around\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i feel that this adventure has helped me become much more compassionate grounded and sure of myself and also have become very centered around my own self care and self love\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i feel like kind of bitchy\nlabel6: False\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i have a feeling this is the real story and i m sympathetic\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i have never shaken the feeling of ferocious protectiveness i had when i first became a mother\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i feel pretty bitter that the story ended the way it did\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i am feeling very cranky\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: im now feeling the need to go back and re read my own lovely picture filled post of all the areas of my state and remind myself again how\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i was feeling quite horny right now and felt the urge to relieve myself of this tension\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i was feeling nostalgic so i thought id put up the video so us spice girls fans can reminisce\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i do this special someone makes me feel so loved amongst the many other things he makes me feel hahaha\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i am left with the sounds of my writing flies buzzing in and out of range the feel of a sweet in my mouth my tinnitus\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i havent even been thinking or feeling as much as i wouldve liked to\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i feel like a failure how in the world am i going to be faithful with those of you who are being encouraged as i pour myself out in this blog every week\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i feel like stop caring about these shits\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i had a caesarean section and within weeks i was feeling really amorous lol\nlabel19: True\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: im feeling impatient about the whole buying a house thing\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: i feel no joy like that the faithful feel viewing the glories of their holy place an horror of great darkness is upon me a fearful dread hath overwhelmed me\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify the statement in data21, we need to analyze it in light of the examples given.

The sentence states:\n\n\"i always feel like i m being impolite if i send it someplace else\"\n\n1. **Identifying the Emotion**: The phrase \"always feel like I\u2019m being impolite\" indicates a concern or discomfort regarding social norms and how actions might be perceived by others.\n\n2. **Context**: The feeling expressed is not one of gratitude, positivity, or contentment; instead, it reflects a conflicted emotion about self-perception and worry about politeness.\n\n3. **Comparison with Examples**: Looking back at previous examples that were labeled as True, they all express positive sentiments, a sense of acceptance, or an acknowledgment of emotions that lead to a constructive reflection. In contrast, data21 reflects a negative sentiment tied to apprehension or guilt.\n\nTherefore, according to the established rule which seems to classify statements expressing positive emotions or clarity about feelings aimed at wellness, this statement fits as negative due to its implication of discomfort.\n\nThus, the classification for data21 is:\n\n<response>false</response>", "true_label": false, "normalized_response": false, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The classification rule used to label the data can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **True Label**: The statement expresses positive emotions, feelings of gratitude, acceptance of current circumstances, introspection, nostalgia, passion, or any other sentiment that resonates with a sense of emotional depth or connection to feelings.

It may describe negative feelings, experiences that are bothersome, or a sense of being unsettled without the inclusion of positive or reflective insights.\n\nIn essence, the rule distinguishes

For instance:\n   - \u201ci could not help from feeling jealous\u201d - False\n   - \u201ci find myself frustrated with christians\u201d - True (Here, the sentiment is critical but still reflects a deep engagement with emotional experience, perhaps leading to its classification as \"True\" depending on context.)\n\n3. **Mixed or Conflicted Feelings**: If a statement contains elements of both positive and negative feelings but leans more towards a negative or less affectionate conclusion, it tends to be classified as \"False.\" However, if it indicates yearning or a positive reflection despite negativity, it can be labeled as \"True\".\n\nIn conclusion, the rule can be summarized as follows: **Statements are labeled \"True\" when they express positive, nostalgic, or affectionate feelings, while those that express negative emotions, indifference, or jealousy are labeled \"False.\"**", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i knew it was coming that we have to part ways and the next time we meet would probably be a billion years later but i couldnt help feeling bitter about it\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: im proud of you and now im starting to feel more and more faithful because of oyu\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i could feel the poisoned hateful angry buildup leaving and it made me feel lighter\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel like jane goodall being accepted into the chimpanzee family\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i have a feeling that thomas jefferson john jay benjamin franklin john adams james madison and many other founding fathers would be appalled at what has happened to this nation\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i feel so jealous seeing them balik kampung\nlabel6: False\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i love just randomly making out with biys but then there is always my whole issue of feeling slutty and wanting to avoid them for the rest of my life\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i just get so attached to the guy im dating usually though its not this bad but iv been so emotional this last year that i just feel greedy and selfish for wanting him here at this very moment\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i am feeling grouchy and angry\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i feel that if i am faithful to god he will help me so that one day i can live solely off of the money i make from mcj\nlabel10: True\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i get the feeling that king ambhi wouldn t have bothered too much about wrapping these gifts nor would the outward appearance have mattered to young alexander who doubtless was already thinking about his next conquest\nlabel11: False\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel like this shows the change that many countries have taken and that many countries are on the way to making this decision that includes supporting and increasing women in all areas of life\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i have been advocating on behalf clients in litigation matters of all nature for years and am fortunate to still feel passionate about my career\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i look at this experience and feel so blessed\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: im feeling the nostalgic vibes already\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i must have been feeling a little cranky about the\nlabel16: False\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i have a brain tumor in my left hypothalamus not sure if related but i have been feeling extremely irritable and sad almost like i m going to have an outburst of anger and i have also had problems with speaking today i tried to talk but my words would not come out right\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i do well also makes me feel loved and i can make more of an effort to share my accomplishments with friends or with my parents who are uber reliable cheerleaders for anything i am delighted about\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i feel a sense of movement yet it is gentle\nlabel19: True\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i don t know why not feeling as sympathetic\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: i feel so bluh and bitter afterward\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify data21 based on the examples provided, we analyze the emotional tone and sentiment expressed in the sentence:\n\n- The phrase \"I feel so bluh and bitter afterward\" conveys feelings of disappointment and negativity.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the rule that appears to be applied:\n\n1. **Positive Emotional Expression**: Statements that convey positive emotions, feelings of affection, nostalgia, or even acceptance tend to be labeled \"True.\" For instance: \n   - \"i feel that i am a generous person\" (True)\n   - \"i approach the end of this course finally i am already feeling a little nostalgic\" (True)\n   - \"i feel very generous and loving lately\" (True)\n\n2. **Negative Emotional Expression**: Statements that reflect negative emotions, such as anger, resentment, jealousy, or frustration, tend to receive a \"False\" label.

For instance:\n   - \"i guess what i m trying to say here is i need to talk to some one who knows first hand what it feels like\" (True)\n\n4. **Ambiguity and Non-Emotional Statements**: Sentences that are ambiguous or do not pertain to emotional states might either not be present or lean towards True/False based on underlying sentiments expressed even if the wording is not overtly emotional. \n\n5. **Terminology Related to Sensation or Feeling**: The use of terms that relate to feeling or emotional state plays an important role.

Many of them reflect more neutral, indifferent, or negative sentiments without an emotional engagement that is characteristic of the \"True\" labels. They can indicate irritation, annoyance, or mundane situations without a feeling of emotional connection or warmth.\n\n3. **Emotional Depth**: True labels typically involve strong emotional undertones such as yearning, love, loss, or strong personal reflections. In contrast, False labels usually depict everyday frustrations, lack of emotional resonance, or rather detached expressions of opinion.\n\n4. **Use of Personal Experiences**: True statements often involve personal or relatable experiences that resonate on an emotional level, while False statements might recount more factual or observational feelings that lack that personal, emotional impact.\n\n5. **Context of Feelings**: The context in which feelings are expressed is also important. Statements that discuss affection (like fond memories, love language, or deep sorrow) tend to be classified as True, while those that highlight irritation or a non-emotional experience are categorized

Statements labeled \"True\" often include positive or passionate expressions (e.g., feelings of happiness, love, support, or a desire to invest time).\n   - Statements labeled \"False\" often indicate confusion, negativity, detachment, or emotions that do not carry a positive or affirmative weight (e.g., frustration, jealousy, anger, indifference).\n\n2. **Examples of True Labels**:\n   - Example 1: Expresses feelings of loss but conveys a sense of purging those feelings, implying a transformative or passionate engagement.\n   - Example 4: Discusses passion for writing, a positive engagement with the activity.\n   - Example 8: Expresses self-reflection about support, indicating a desire to do better.\n   - Example 14: Shows a feeling of happiness upon completion but acknowledges a struggle with compassion, showing depth.\n   - Example 15: Directly expresses love.\n\n3. **Examples of False Labels**:\n   - Example 2: Conveys a sense of rudeness due to inability, indicating dissatisfaction.\n   - Example 5: States a disconnection from feeling offended, implying indifference.\n   - Example 9: Describes a physical sensation without emotional depth.\n   - Example 11: Expresses feelings of anger and bitterness, but in a negative context.\n   - Example 18: Indicates frustration and a feeling of being overwhelmed.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe rule for classification seems to hinge on judging whether the statement conveys a meaningful emotional engagement (label \"True\") versus a lack of positive emotional connection or engagement (label \"False\").", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i can express my feelings about accepted restrictive norms on women s rights and freedoms\nlabel1: True\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i wonder how many parents having lost the helm of their family to external influences schools teachers other children drugs sports etc feel as irritable as i\nlabel2: False\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i still somehow managed to dawdle just enough to feel rushed\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feels that someone hurts her heart by a knife she adores her mother in law she never imagines that that generous and kind woman will look at her that killer look arnav was looking at her no\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i imagine sitting at a fire at party with someone you really care about trying to tell them how you feel waiting and longing for the moment and feeling so many mixed feelings\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i feel like i still have not accepted that you will never be physically here on this earth with me\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i find myself annoyed more often than i find myself feeling compassionate\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i feel is just infatuation and not a compassionate love that s why letting you go in not hard\nlabel8: True\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i wont feel selfish about it\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i want to grow from now on without forgetting the feeling of thanks to all people supporting me\nlabel10: True\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i am fiercely protective of my brother so when i overhear the arguments they have and how he runs after her i feel uselessly mad\nlabel11: False\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i maybe i up being now smaller compared people face really taught feel quite gracious\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i feel other possibilities sdeffaniiy jennafer temptest delicate deskek walaniga hailee dayzeh dillie mae brokk aidez pronounced eye dez wama alaneu poet i almost cried reading your answer i m crying a href http www\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i am feeling today which medications i am taking and how people are rude and lack respect\nlabel14: False\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i see in episcopalian conservatives can readily be explained by the grief they feel at the destruction of their beloved church both tec and the larger anglican communion\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i feel annoyed by people talking to me in the day but then im so desperate for someone to talk to at night\nlabel16: False\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i strive to make myself slightly different in order to feel liked by those around me\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i feel like i have so much love to give lovely feelings to share\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i feel like im reaching the end of my rope and im so irritible and aggravated right now\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: im sorry or pobresito instead of poor boy because seriously who says poor boy girl when youre feeling sympathetic nowadays\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: i have begun to feel irrationally resentful and angry towards people\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify the data, we can infer a general rule based on the examples provided.

Sentences labeled **True** often express clear, direct feelings or emotions. They may include feelings of tenderness, happiness, nostalgia, or any form of emotional vulnerability.\n2. Sentences labeled **False** tend to express a lack of strong emotional connection, frustration, annoyance, or more neutral observations about feelings that do not convey personal emotional depth.\n\nLooking at data21:\n- **data21**: \"i have more pictures but i would feel obnoxious posting more than this\"\n- The phrase \"would feel obnoxious\" shows an internal recognition of the feeling of being obnoxious, but it does not indicate a deep emotional state or vulnerability. It seems more reflective on social considerations rather than expressing a raw emotional state.\n\nBased on the analysis, \"I would feel obnoxious posting more than this\" can be interpreted as a less substantial emotional statement compared to the \"True\" examples, which typically convey a strong emotional or personal experience.\n\nThus, according to the identified rule, data21 would fall into the **False** category.\n\n<response>false</response>", "true_label": false, "normalized_response": false, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The rule for classifying the provided data appears to be based on the emotional context conveyed in each statement.

frustration, annoyance, or any negative emotions, ambiguity in feelings, or a lack of a strong emotional stance are labeled as \"False.\"\n\n3. **Physical Sensations**: Statements about physical feelings that relate to emotions (such as tenderness or sensations of physical discomfort) are also classified as \"True.\" \n\nIn summation, the rule can be articulated as follows:\n\n- Label \"True\" if the statement conveys a clear emotional feeling (positive or vulnerable) or a specific physical sensation that connects to an emotional state.\n- Label \"False\" if the statement expresses

For instance, \"I feel so distracted from everything\" might suggest strong feelings of anxiety, even though it's not overtly positive or negative.\n\n4. **Contextual Use of \"Feel\"**: The usage of \"feel\" seems pivotal.

Conversely, \"False\" is assigned when the expression seems superficial, sarcastic, or lacks significant emotional depth.\n\nIn data21, the phrase \"i feel very sarcastic\" suggests a tone of sarcasm rather than genuine emotion. The qualification \"kind of bitter\" also indicates a more superficial expression of feeling rather than a deep emotional experience. \n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the sentiment expressed in data21 is not particularly reflective of a profound or genuine emotional state.\n\nTherefore, applying the rule:\n<response>false</response>", "true_label": false, "normalized_response": false, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The classification of the data appears to be based on the emotional state or sentiment expressed in each statement.

These often indicate a level of vulnerability or reflective thought about feelings, pain, or connection to others.\n\n2. **Surface Level Sentiment**: Statements labeled as \"False\" tend to convey feelings that are more superficial, sarcastic, or lack significant emotional weight. These include mentions of irritation, annoyance, or anger without deeper emotional context. They may also include commentary on external situations rather than personal emotional experiences.\n\n3. **Keywords and Phrasing**: \n   - Phrases that indicate regret, pain, longing, connection to others' suffering, or a struggle with strong feelings typically fall into the \"True\" category.\n   - Phrases that include dismissive sentiments, sarcasm, or emotional detachment tend to fall into the \"False\" category.\n\n4. **Contrasting Empathy with Indifference**: Where empathy and a connection to personal or shared experiences are discussed, the label is more likely to be \"True.\" In contrast, when the sentiment is dismissive or focused on personal annoyance without empathy, the label is \"False.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the rule for classification can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Rule**: Sentences expressing deep emotional experiences or empathy towards oneself or others are labeled \"True,\" while those that convey superficial feelings, sarcasm, or a lack of deep emotional engagement are labeled \"False.\"", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: sometime ago i felt very angry when my mother wrote me telling me that my elder sister was messing up things at home by her internalised aggressive attitude towards parents and her husband\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i finally towards the later parts in training began to feel at comfort with my handling so i was loving the chance to try out my skills work\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i also feel greedy and ashamed\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel so treasured by men of my race now and im sure this will influence men of other races and ethnic groups to not treat me like whore\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i save the smaller ones for my ass but if i am feeling really horny a nice hard carrot will take me where i need to go\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i feel like im secretly hated by them and they wont tell me even when i beg on my hands and knees\nlabel6: False\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i havent fed yet and i feel very amorous\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i see that many devotees in iskcon are loosing their feeling of belonging to a caring spiritual family\nlabel8: True\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: im just used to the attention i got from brad which at times i felt was way too much attention and was overbearing but a little i feel would be considerate\nlabel9: True\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i really need to be determined in expressing my feelings in a more compassionate way rather than taking it out on my husband\nlabel10: True\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: ive been feeling resentful lately and im not sure where its coming from\nlabel11: False\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel was relatively gracious since i was sort of the one who was uh semi dumped she continues to be peculiarly distant and impassive about spending time with me\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: im always feeling fucked\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i am constantly focused on the fans behind me what are they saying how are they feeling are they rude am i being rude etc\nlabel14: False\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i feel very fond of him what with his strong independent spirit\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: ill eat when im feeling spiteful and defiant\nlabel16: False\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i feel like a grouchy old lady today so pleaseplease don t irritate me\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i was feeling quite grumpy yesterday but i m better today\nlabel18: False\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i know what i would feel the pain then become furious and then feel confused hurt and even more furious\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i feel to be fond of you in fact before accommodate oneself to by you only very much self is very stupid regret that\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: im only invited somewhere if you feel like being bitchy or you need advic on buying the pair of perfect shoes\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify data21, we need to analyze its content and see if it aligns with the established pattern in the labeled examples.\n\nIn the provided examples, the \"True\" labels are associated with feelings of positivity, affection, excitement, or comfort.

They often include specific wording indicating a positive state of mind or connection to emotions (e.g., feeling treasured, sympathetic, passionate, beautiful, etc.). \n\n2. **False Labels**: In contrast, the sentences categorized as false often express negativity, dissatisfaction, uncertainty, or an emotional absence. They may indicate a lack of feeling or a sense of emotional struggle rather than a positive or affirming sentiment.\n\nTherefore, the classification rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **True**: Texts that convey positive emotions, positive feelings, or affirming thoughts.\n- **False**: Texts that convey negative emotions, dissatisfaction, emotional absence, or struggles. \n\nThis understanding allows one to assess the text based on the sentiment and emotional expressions conveyed within each individual statement.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i feel like i am not a very faithful friend son brother uncle co worker or church member\nlabel1: True\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i could drink normally and feeling resentful and of thinking how the fuck can i do this forever and toying with thoughts of if it would really be such a big deal if i drank again\nlabel2: False\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i know i feel passionate about certain things being a better route to take but i am sure all my ways are not the correct ones but i feel listening to other points of view helps shape my thinking\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel fond toward though they may not realize it\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i ended up bragging gillian to help me study on sunday and helping thanh a bit with his assignment instead ok i am feeling really pissed off and hungry right now\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i love being able to publish online but sometimes i cant help but feel that ache and longing for handwritten things and pleasures of a simpler time\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i feel they are a lot less dangerous than huth and jones\nlabel7: False\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i can have such a negative impact on one person that even though we are now completely apart she can still feel so strongly for in such a hateful way\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i feel grouchy and disorganized\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i used to feel really sympathetic to shizumasa but with each chapter i just seem to start disliking him more and more\nlabel10: True\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i feel about men in a romantic sense has a lot more to do with how i feel about myself than how i feel about them\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i was feeling a bit resentful that i had just slaved away for years and my hard work seemed unrecognizable to others in my community and my society\nlabel12: False\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i call someone i feel like i need to at least talk a few minutes to not be rude\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i want more am feeling greedy oh yeah\nlabel14: False\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i know i know football makes people happy and football programs pay for themselves make alumni feel loyal and warm and fuzzy and willing to donate yada yada yada\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i voice out how i feel its never accepted at least in front of you\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: im also a bit sick of feeling like i really really need something sweet no matter how great cake is\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i still don t feel so hot i said as aj frowned\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: id get that sickly sexual twisting feeling the type i only get now from looking over a dangerous ledge\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i feel as if i am a caring person\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: i feel like i am falling into my naughty ways of eating even though i am sticking with the raw snack foods\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify data21, we analyze the content of the statement.
