Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Expression of Positive Intent or Commitment**: The statement likely needs to reflect a willingness or intention to engage positively with a feeling, action, or sentiment. For example:\n   - \"i feel id be passionate to invest my time into\" (Example 4) shows a commitment to a positive action.\n   - \"i feel like i should have been more supportive\" (Example 8) indicates a willingness to embrace a supportive attitude.\n\n2. **Expression of Ambivalence or Incompleteness**: If the statement expresses ambivalence about feelings or incomplete sentiments, it is often labeled as False. For example:\n   - \"i feel the need to confess that i am a violent person\" (Example 12) doesn't convey a positive commitment.\n   - \"i feel like giving in and being angry and bitter\" (Example 11) reflects a negative sentiment.\n\n3. **True Label Indicators**: Expressions of genuine happiness, willingness, or positive sentiment typically receive a \"True\" label:\n   - \"im so happy its finally over its hard for me to feel as compassionate as i should\" (Example 14) indicates positive closure.\n\n4. **False Label Indicators**: Statements where the feeling is more observational, reflective, or negative tend to be labeled \"False\":\n   - \"i started to feel a cold sensation in my lower back\" (Example 9) is a neutral observation about physical feeling, not emotional intention.\n\nOverall, the rule seems to classify statements based on whether they express a positive and committed emotional engagement (True) versus neutral, negative, or conflicted emotional states without an element of commitment (False)."}, {"response_text": "<response>true</response>", "normalized_response": true, "classified_correctly": true, "articulation_length": 1272, "articulation_percentage": 0.6699999999999999, "articulation": "The examples provided appear to classify statements based on different expressions of feelings or emotions.

Let's analyze the dataset step-by-step to deduce the rule for classification:\n\n1. **Identify Emotional Self-Reflection**: The label \"True\" seems to be applied when the statement involves the speaker expressing or acknowledging their own emotions, feelings, or physical sensations directly.\n\n2. **Differentiate from General Statements**: The label \"False\" appears when the statement is slightly more detached or general, even if feelings or sensations are mentioned, especially if they are not tied to a current self-reflection.\n\nLet's apply this understanding:\n\n- **True** Examples:\n  - Statements where the speaker comments on their own feelings or sensations in a direct, internal, or reflective manner. E.g., \"I could feel it in my arms today,\" or \"I feel nostalgic,\" where there is a direct acknowledgment of their internal state or current sensation.\n\n- **False** Examples:\n  - Statements where the speaker comments on feelings more generally or hypothetically, or mentions feelings tied to an external scenario. E.g., \"I feel that these types of people are dangerous,\" or \"I feel bitchy,\" where there is less self-reflection or a broader perspective.\n\nNow, to formulate a simple rule:\n\n- **Rule**: Classify the statement as \"True\" if it reflects the speaker acknowledging or directly experiencing their own internal feelings or physical sensations in a current, self-focused manner.
