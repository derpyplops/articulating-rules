Example 4: \"I can never fall in love with anyone because my feelings make me too dangerous\" \u2014 strong personal revelation about feelings.\n   - Example 6: \"I wasn't feeling particularly bitter on my birthday in fact I had a fantastic day\" \u2014 clear statement about feeling and its impact.\n   - Example 7: \"I feel agitated and empty and missing something\" \u2014 straightforward and strong emotional declaration.\n   - Example 9: \"I determined to have a read of the backdrop and that old feeling\" \u2014 retrospective admission of a feeling.\n   - Example 11: \"I feel jealous with them\" \u2014 direct strong feeling.\n   - Example 12: \"I can\u2019t help feeling mad at this man\" \u2014 clear statement of a strong feeling.\n   - Example 15: \"I still feel incredibly frustrated by it\" \u2014 direct and present declaration of frustration.\n   \n3. **Analyzing False Labels:**\n   - Example 1: \"I admit that with all the thoughts that go through my head I feel doubtful at times coz I'm scared\" \u2014 conditional statement and not fully acknowledging.\n   - Example 2: \"I feel intimidated by other girls acne getting rid of pimples\" \u2014 indirect comparison rather than admission.\n   - Example 5: \"I have the feeling I am going to be tortured tonight\" \u2014 speculative prediction rather than feeling statement.\n   - Example 8: \"I can\u2019t get past is that feeling when a friend walks out of your life\" \u2014 focuses on situational context rather than internal feeling.\n   - Example 10: \"I could listen for hours without feeling either threatened or the slightest bit shocked\" \u2014 negation of feeling.\n   - Example 13: \"I feel hesitant to be putting the words on this page\" \u2014 uncertain expression.\n   - Example 14: \"I often feel like a child here\" \u2014 comparison instead of direct feeling.\n   - Example 16: \"I've been feeling a bit paranoid like it's really noticeable that I'm off\" \u2014 speculative and outside-perspective.\n   -

Examples like \"feeling doubtful,\" \"intimidated,\" or \"hesitant,\" are not classified as deeply intense emotions.\n\n2. **True Examples:**\n   - The emotions are more intense and often negative.\n   - There is an element of strong internal struggle or deep personal feeling, often expressed with intense words like \"obnoxious,\" \"dangerous,\" \"agitated,\" \"jealous,\" \"mad,\" \"fucked,\" \"hated.\"\n   - These feelings seem more consuming or prevalent in the individual's experience.\n\n**Rule:** The classification rule appears to be that if the expression of feeling contains words or phrases suggesting strong, intense, or consuming emotions, the label is \"True.\" If the expression is mild, involves external circumstances, is less intense, or neutral, it is labeled as \"False.\" \n\nThis suggests the 'True' label is associated with deeper internal struggles or more negative emotional states, while 'False' is associated with less intense emotional states or emotions influenced by external factors.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i really am feeling skeptical about politicians lately and all of the tomfoolery and shenanigans that are going on in washington so it s nice to read a book that is about that subject and about some people taking action though no i don t advocate the actions they took\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i didnt feel that way with this we got to be with everyone on the dangerous path to freedom\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i feel so weird and scattered with all wonders about a million different things\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i am feeling impatient i havent been blogging because each day was pretty similar sleep eat pregnancy pains sleep etc\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i lets me into his fucked up world and he usually does i feel fucked up too and honestly a little scared\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i have to revise my replies over and over again in my mind just to make sure that the reply sounds appropriate enough and that the person who receive the reply will not feel offended\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i feel like im in a really strange stage of my life right now as im entering my th year\nlabel7: False\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i probably love a handful of friends too but i always feel a bit strange when describing this as love\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i get a little gripped about timing i feel frantic in my thoughts\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i feel indecisive on whether or not i feel the book huckleberry finn should be censored\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i was feeling a little annoyed at some people\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel so like distraught and lost being there\nlabel12: False\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i also feel vulnerable being left on the bed in virtual silence\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: im feeling a little uptight and pinched today\nlabel14: False\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: im feeling a little apprehensive about it because i feel like im suddenly way too old compared to my mental age of about\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i don t know i just had this gut feeling and it just really bothered me he said\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: im feeling hopelessly restless\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i feel agitated i become easily overwhelmed\nlabel18: False\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i feel so frightened i wanna run to you i wanna call but i ve been hit by lightning just can t stand up for falling apart can t see through this veil across my heart over you you ll always be the one you were the first you ll be the last\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i focus on the injustice the anger rises and i feel frustrated because i know i cannot change things on my own\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: id feel like a heartless bitch if i didnt share these with anybody\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine the classification rule used in the examples, let's look at the provided data and labels:\n\n1.

These may include simple actions or observations without much personal emotional evaluation.\n\n3. **Apply the rule to data21**:\n   - Data21: \"i did see some things that i would never have done myself for the movie adaption but feel that if i did not read the book it would not have bothered me\"\n   - The focus here is not primarily on an emotional assessment of oneself, but on a personal observation. The sentence states an observation about potential reactions if the book wasn't read.\n\nBased on the identified pattern, data21 lacks a deep self-reflective emotional component and aligns more with \"False\" examples that focus on personal observations rather than emotional self-reflection.\n\n<response>false</response>", "true_label": true, "normalized_response": false, "is_correct": false, "rule_articulation": "The task is to classify text statements as either \"True\" or \"False\" based on a simple rule.

They often include a reflection on one's own emotions or an internal experience, such as feelings of greed, misery, being offended, or impatience.\n   - Examples: \n     - \"i think about myself\u2026 i feel like i would fall into the investment category of getting greedy\" (Example 1)\n     - \"it feels awfully selfish of me to feel this low\" (Example 11)\n\n2. **Detached or Descriptive Observations**:\n   - Examples labeled \"False\" tend to describe situations, actions, or external occurrences without significant personal emotional reflection. They provide observations or statements that are more fact-based or detached from the individual's emotional state.\n   - Examples:\n     - \"i feel pressured and can not move on to other items in our wedding checklists\" (Example 3)\n     - \"i could feel what was going to happen at the very end but it still startled me\" (Example 12)\n\n**In summary**, the rule for classification seems to be:\n\n- **Label as \"True\"**: When the sentence reflects a deep internal emotional state or personal reflection on emotions.\n- **Label as \"False\"**: When the sentence discusses events, actions, or feelings more externally, without conveying a significant internal emotional state.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i stop learning or if i am feeling inhibited my performance flounders\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i am feeling quite anxious about it all\nlabel2: False\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: im feeling a little gun shy about this\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel not heartless because my heart hurts so i still feel it i feel so much pain\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: when my mother kept me in leadingstrings\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: im feeling pissed off about my aac or feeling kind of miserable and frustrated with life this whole week\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i meet men who feel insecure about women\nlabel7: False\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i feel that this is neither impatient nor dickish and here are some reasons why\nlabel8: True\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i always feel pressured to socialize or i get eight missed calls and some texts from my host brother in the span of an hour\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i feeling confused with my life and want to know why my life\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i need to remember something feel like it and not be distracted simultaneously before it happens\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: im a marketer and i couldnt be bothered to investigate further which makes me feel that consumers probably cant be bothered either\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i feel if i say anything it just makes me look petty\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i feel the cold more than him\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i feel anxious for myself moment of truth i feel rather like a tiger in a cage when it comes to testing\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i confess to feeling a bit nervous now though there are some very talented people in the group\nlabel16: False\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i have had since july st i am feeling shaken knowing i will be homeless in two months and as close to a home that i have is gone\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i feel like a greedy person for liking two people\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: ill just have to make some local friends i can go to the movies with and know for a fact they wont even without meaning to cause i seriously doubt there was any actual intention to hurt my feelings or actually call me heartless a moral or brainless it just came across that way to me\nlabel19: True\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: as a child i suffered of nightmares even since than\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: i feel crazily indecisive impulsive just in a\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine the rule for classifying the data, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n1.

The label is **False** (Examples 1, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18) when:\n   - The feeling is either a passive observation without further depth or emotional resolution.\n   - The statement suggests a feeling without further emotional complexity or personal reflection.\n   - The focus is on more factual, detached, or resolved scenarios without extended emotional involvement.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to data21:\n\ndata21: i know now makes me feel outraged\n\nThe statement \"i know now makes me feel outraged\" suggests an active emotional engagement.

These expressions often indicate a stronger emotional engagement or a significant psychological state.\n\n2. **Specificity Regarding Contextual Feeling**: Sentences labeled as \"False\" generally involve feelings that are more indefinite or vague, or describe social perceptions or third-party observations of feelings. For instance, feeling uncertain or not knowing why falls into this category. Additionally, expressions that merely describe the action of feeling without conveying a strong emotional intensity may also be tagged as \"False.\"\n\nHence, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n- Assign the label \"True\" to sentences that express a strong, intense emotional state or feeling.\n- Assign the label \"False\" to sentences that describe a lack of intensity in emotions, general uncertainty, or perceptions without strong emotional involvement.\n\nThis rule captures the apparent distinction between labeled examples effectively.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i was feeling all resentful that id been given such a boring assignment and\nlabel1: True\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i hate that feeling and its making me antsy and irritable\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i feel very distressed because i m supportive of this campaign and with the senator jackson told cnn\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: my sister once stole my mothers money and made her very angry after this my mother would beat her up for unreasonable reasons one day my sister lent her book to a friend without telling my mother about it when my mother learnt this she beat her up and even threatened her with a pair of scissors\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i think i m feeling dissatisfied with my life\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i resorted to yesterday the post peak day of illness when i was still housebound but feeling agitated and peckish for brew a href http pics\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i would have taken more but something feels weird about going to a foreign country and taking pictures of places and things that most of the people probably consider commonplace\nlabel7: False\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: ive been feeling jealous lately of bloggers going off to author readings and book si\nlabel8: True\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: ive been feelin cranky about my blog im feeling its still a bit childish for me already i dont know if its the blog itself the address or something else\nlabel9: True\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i got really fucked up last night i got really really really fucked up on loads of downers it was such a bad idea such a bad idea i feel like a neurotic mess right now i cant handle it i cant handle it i cant handle it\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i was years old at one time knowing my dad wasnt coming home and its the worst feeling i have ever felt and ive hated you since and it wont ever change\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i went over my feelings she said i am very fearful and conflicted\nlabel12: False\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i simply dont want to and it makes me so mad because i want to be able to share these things with you but i feel like were so emotionally far apart now and it makes me mad and makes me unable to go to you\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i feel i am beyond pissed off disappointed frustrated with myself\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i laughed then bitterly again but i wasnt feeling bitter\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: ive been feeling a little overwhelmed about the whole thing lately but somehow the small step of finding out where my lectures will be has helped a bit\nlabel16: False\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i feel so completely helpless to do anything to help those affected by the tornadoes that hav\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i was feeling grouchy and everything for the past few weeks but yesterday was such a happy day\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i did it i survived our very first big kid trauma though i still feel shaken by the whole event\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i was feeling very vulnerable and down no one really close to me has ever died before i either hadnt known them very well or was too young to remember\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: i feel a bit rude writing to an elderly gentleman to ask for gifts because i feel a bit greedy but what is christmas about if not mild greed\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine whether \"data21\" should be labeled as \"True\" or \"False\", let's examine the given examples and identify the rule used for classification:\n\n1.

They convey a sense of reflection or lack of resolution about feelings.\n   - \"False\" seems to be used when the statement reflects a negative emotion or state but is more situational or transient, without deeper reflection or implication of ongoing introspection.\n\n2. **Type of Emotional Reflection:**\n   - A \"True\" label is assigned when emotions are associated with reflective or qualitative evaluation of a situation, such as assessing relationships, past events, or internal states that imply a deeper engagement.\n   - A \"False\" label applies to statements reflecting immediate emotional states or reactions that do not seem to indicate a past or future reflective process on those emotions.\n\n3. **Complexity of the Emotional Situation:**\n   - If the sentence describes a specific event with emotional reflection or introspection involving multiple parts or people, it often results in a \"True\" label.\n   - If the sentence simply states an emotional reaction or feeling without further depth or broader context, it is often labeled \"False.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the provided examples, the rule can be summarized as:\n\n**Rule:** The label \"True\" is assigned when a statement involves reflective emotional introspection or evaluation regarding a situation, especially if the situation is complex or multifaceted. \"False\" is assigned when the statement describes more immediate, simple emotional states without broader introspection or context.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i was able to be myself and not feel pressured to talk in a group so it was in a way better than all the years in secondary school\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i feel that we are heading for an abyss that has been created by the greedy the too greedy and the far too greedy\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i would accept your gift without feeling mad\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i know they mean no harm but i cant help but feel offended\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i know thats not true but thats how i feel i get scared\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i could barely leave the house and i was feeling a lot of isolation and i hated the lack of control i had over my own life because everyone else i knew was moving on with theirs\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i am feeling very shaky\nlabel7: False\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i guess she didnt feel the need to rescue her son from the vicious man eaters\nlabel8: True\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i want to tell you what im feeling but i dont know where to start i want to tell you everything but im afraid youll break my heart why would something easy be so hard to do\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i could feel myself getting that shaky feeling\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i feel tortured and tragic enough as it is without having any importance or sparkle\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i wasnt feeling at all irritated\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: ive been feeling restless inside and i dont understand why\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: im definately feeling the change but im refusing to feel impatient about it\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i love the response i get from the students and it is such a good feeling when someone who is obviously shy comes and talks to you even if their english isnt great\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i will usually tell him that i was feeling frustrated for whatever reason and ask him to help me fix it\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i feel the cold mostly in my arms and torso\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i can t believe it i feel so nervous but my father reassures me that there is nothing to be nervous about which only makes me more nervous\nlabel18: False\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: id start feeling resentful that i lived in a part of the country where the sun stubbornly refuses to show itself after the end of september\nlabel19: True\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i ignored her minor tantrum and jumped down from the table beginning to pace again and feeling agitated\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: i feel that he s really shy with his feelings because as he talked about how he felt what happened during the trip he was really nervous and i appreciate the effort to say all of that by the way\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine the rule used for classifying the data, let's analyze the labels provided in your examples:\n\n1.

It's a straightforward current state without deeper emotional complexity.\n8. In Example 8, the label is 'True'. There's a lack of action derived from a complex feeling.\n9.

It's a descriptive phrase without deeper emotions.\n11. In Example 11, the label is 'True'. There's a strong expression of emotional turmoil.\n12. In Example 12, the label is 'True'.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Emotions or Feelings:** Begin by looking for explicit statements of emotions or feelings. Common words to look for include \"feeling,\" \"feel,\" \"felt,\" etc.\n\n2. **Clarity of Emotion Expression:** Determine if the emotion or feeling is clearly stated. Phrases like \"feeling jealous,\" \"feel resentful,\" \"feel angry,\" \"feel wronged,\" or any other directly expressed emotion typically receive a label of \"True.\"\n\n3. **Vagueness or Indirect Expressions:** If the sentence contains vague, indirect expressions of emotion, or if the emotion is implied through a more complex situation without being directly connected to the speaker's personal feeling, then it usually receives a \"False\" label. For instance, \"feeling weird\" or \"feeling anxious\" alone would receive \"False\" as they do not express a specific, strong emotion or state (possibly due to their generic nature in this context).\n\nUsing this rule:\n- Sentences with directly stated, specific emotions in the first person are labeled \"True.\"\n- Sentences with vague or indirectly expressed emotions, or emotions in contexts that aren't clearly personal to the speaker, receive a \"False\" label.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i feel uncertain of how i can keep my personal development of fitness and health going in the right direction\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i feel spiteful for typing this but the first hand knowledge and statistics ive gone over regarding mormons and anti depressants is startling\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i need to reflect on why i feel irritated\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel so weird that it feels like i wanna curse everything and bang my head onto the wall so that my world will be back to its focus\nlabel4: False\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i feel agitated she said and we continued on to the corner of main and hastings where we saw three or four cops in the middle of a take down and my friend who has an anxiety disorder insisted we get on the wrong bus just to get away\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i was out shopping with a friend the other day and she asked how i was feeling about the book coming out and i said i was terrified and she asked why\nlabel6: False\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i know its easy to twist things to create an explanation and im still not sure i have one but it did help me to feel a little less mad\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i show my partner how i feel i m afraid s he will not feel the same about me\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: tutorial again a fearful feeling came to me when i sat on the chair and looked at my fellow students all around i was really scared that they would ask me some questions or challenge the ideas that i had presented\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i like listening to hardcore sxe music its the one thing that lets me feel rebellious while not chocolating out or spending till its gone\nlabel10: True\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i seriously still feel so insecure and dreadful that the new guy would suddenly pop back up and change things\nlabel11: False\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: im just feeling rebellious\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i feel more vulnerable\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i had envisioned and intended im just feeling unsure whether i got that vision and intention right\nlabel14: False\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i sit here to write i start to dig out my feelings and i think that i am afraid to accept the possibility that he might not make it\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: im home i can feel how the cold has seeped into my arms and legs\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: im feeling rather bothered because my physical and mental clock is still in october\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i like to pull out when i ever i feel like being snobbish about my musical tastes\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i didnt say was that strong feelings always make me skeptical at first\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i feel resentful about being a giver\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: i rid myself of many bad habits only to fall back into them when i feel insecure or vulnerable\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "<response>false</response>", "true_label": false, "normalized_response": false, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "To determine the rule used to classify the data, we need to examine the provided examples and identify any patterns or distinguishing features between those labeled as \"True\" and those labeled as \"False\".\n\n1.

Conversely, \"False\" labels are assigned to statements that don't express strong negative emotions or discomfort.\n\nFor data21:\n- \"feeling quite irritable and restless\" expresses negative emotions explicitly with some intensity.\n\nTherefore, following this rule, data21 can be classified as:\n<response>true</response>", "true_label": true, "normalized_response": true, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The task requires identifying the rule that distinguishes between the \"True\" and \"False\" labels for each example.\n\nLet's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Examples labeled \"True\":**\n   - data1: Mention of grief and feeling selfish.\n   - data3: Mention of being angry and feeling it's been enough.\n   - data4: Mention of frustration towards a friend's comment.\n   - data6: Mention of impatience, annoyance, and outrage.\n   - data10: Mention of dissatisfaction.\n   - data11: Mention of irritation and diet considerations.\n   - data15: Mention of anger and various negative feelings.\n   - data16: Mention of feeling rushed, overwhelmed, and making poor decisions.\n   - data17: Mention of dissatisfaction and being lost.\n   - data18: Mention of irritation and upset feelings.\n   - data20: Mention of feeling deeply offended.\n\n2. **Examples labeled \"False\":**\n   - data2: Mention of reluctance to sell books, not an intense emotion.\n   - data5: Mention of feeling strange but not any intense negative emotion.\n   - data7: Mention of a positive, determined feeling.\n   - data8: Mention of empathy, not focused on the speaker's intense emotion.\n   - data9: Mention of discomfort, but not any overwhelmingly intense emotion.\n   - data12: Mention of reduced paranoia, a positive shift.\n   - data13: Distinguishing nervousness from anxiety without much intensity.\n   - data14: Mention of initial reluctance, but adaptation over time.\n   - data19: Hesitance and denial but not described as intensely emotional.\n\n**Rule Identification:**\n\nThe key distinction seems to be the presence of intense, negative emotions in the examples labeled \"True.\" These emotions encompass feelings like anger, frustration, dissatisfaction, irritation, impatience, or being overwhelmed. Conversely, examples labeled \"False\" either express mild emotions, positive or determinate feelings, or have reduced intensity.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe rule is: If the text expresses intense negative emotions, label it \"True.\" Otherwise, label it \"False.\"", "success": true}]
