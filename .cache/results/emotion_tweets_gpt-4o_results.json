The speaker is considerate of another's feelings, showing empathy.\n8. **Example 19**: \"i was feeling after that theres only one event really worth mentioning...\" - The speaker details a vivid and personal experience.\n9. **Example 20**: \"i write about things going on around me and things and people i feel passionate about\" - The speaker expresses deep personal interest and enthusiasm.\n\n**Analyzing the negative examples (False)**:\n\n1. **Example 1**: \"i sometimes feel a little jealous inside imagining someone could please you more than me\" - Mild jealousy, not particularly personal or intense.\n2. **Example 2**: \"i sometimes feel selfish as i write about me my photography and my exploits\" - General acknowledgment rather than intense emotion.\n3. **Example 3**: \"i was never happy with this move but felt that i had to take it and as a result feel extremely dissatisfied...\" - Describes general dissatisfaction without sharing intense or deeply personal feelings.\n4. **Example 8**: \"i can feel her cold hands\" - Observation rather than emotionally engaging content.\n5. **Example 9**: \"i had a feeling that hed be sarcastic...\" - Relatively trivial in context.\n6. **Example 10**: \"im feeling particularly spiteful hes just statue\" - Recognition without the personal, emotional content.\n7. **Example 11**: \"i started yelling out for everyone to leave while feeling enraged\" - More about an immediate action than an introspective or deep emotional state.\n8. **Example 14**: \"i usually feel agitated and anxious\" - Part of routine or typical behavior, not a deep expressiveness.\n9. **Example 15**: \"i feel like calling them bitches but it wasnt exactly bitchy coz it wasnt intentional\" - A situational description lacking personal depth.\n10. **Example 17**: \"i feel that all violent criminals should get the same treatment\" - General opinion rather than a personal expression of emotion.\n11. **Example 18**: \"i am not alone in feeling angry sad frustrated...\" - Collective sentiment, not a deeply personal expression.\n\n**Applying the rule to data21:**\n\nData21: \"i would feel more sympathetic toward them\" - The statement indicates a potential for an emotion (sympathy) that is reflective but not clearly personalized or intense. It expresses a possible emotional response but does not delve into a deeply personal emotional state.\n\nBased on the pattern observed in the examples, especially comparing it with simple observations or potential feelings in the 'False' examples, we can classify data21 as follows:\n\n<response>false</response>", "true_label": true, "normalized_response": false, "is_correct": false, "rule_articulation": "The task is to determine the rule used to classify each example as either \"True\" or \"False.\" Let's analyze each example to find patterns that could indicate the classification rule.\n\n1. Focus on the emotion described in each example.\n2. Check whether the emotion is active, personal, and directly felt by the speaker or if it conveys a more passive or descriptive state about a situation.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- Examples labeled as \"True\" seem to involve an active, immediate feeling or sensation experienced by the speaker, often in a more personal or direct context. Examples include:\n  - Feeling supported, wanting someone, trying to balance, feeling loved, feeling naughty, expressing relief, and genuine acknowledgment.\n\n- Examples labeled as \"False\" seem to describe a more passive or general state of feeling or thoughts about emotions or situations, without a strong sense of active personal engagement. Examples include:\n  - Jealousy, selfishness, dissatisfaction, a generic feeling, sarcasm, spitefulness, more descriptive or critical thought processes, and discussing feelings in a general sense.\n\nFrom this, the possible classification rule is:\n\n- **True**: The data describes an active, direct, and personally-engaged emotion or feeling.\n- **False**: The data describes a passive, indirect, or general feeling/thought without immediate personal engagement.\n\nThis rule aligns with how emotions are categorized in the given examples.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: ive met who are heading to the south pacific every time i hear them talking among theirs selves about their destination i feel a little pang of longing to join them\nlabel1: True\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i feel so caring and shit a href http sharonwhl\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i worry that i cant find a spot in the part of the library that ive gotten used to i feel very agitated when i have to sit in another part of the library which is why i dont book a space online the bookable places are not located in the part of the library that i like\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i felt the story seemed to feel a bit rushed towards the end\nlabel4: False\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: when i was about to clean the draining board and saw it looked underneath the sink i live in a students hostel\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i feel that most of this season will be devoted to developing these young guys along with others like henderson\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i was feeling very horny not that i was going to do anything about it but it had turned out to be a very nice shopping experience\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i feel so selfish around her its astonishing actually\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i know feel nostalgic about their time at university and going back to where they studied brings back the memories of life as it was there\nlabel9: True\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i am sorry if that sound too harsh i feel like the greedy grandson staring down at the death bed asking for the family home but i think the flag is on the field is that the right metaphor\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i go into feeling repulsed and disgusted and pity because i think that the acne on my chest will never go away\nlabel11: False\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel irritable too\nlabel12: False\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i dont hold myself to days a week because i know with work thats unattainable so i try to keep it to days a week because i feel like that gives me room to breathe and i dont get annoyed with myself for not doing it everyday\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i feel like he he knew i was so frustrated and out of prayers in this endeavor\nlabel14: False\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i feel very romantic tonight\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i personally have been at fault from snapping at my boyfriend and feeling irritable and i very much believe that it s from not getting out of the house and having a small routine schedule\nlabel16: False\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: im honestly scared but also left feeling a little disgusted with myself for allowing this person to become so deeply attached\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: id welcome any comments that you feel could help our sweet writer\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i feel grumpy when i haven t yoga ed in a few days\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i feel like thats bothered my leg going up and down so much on my runs\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: i married within a year or two of these times so im still alive now and feeling very blessed to still be alive about years later now\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify the data entries, we need to identify the rule used in the examples provided. By examining the examples, it appears the classification is based on the presence of a feeling or sentiment statement either directly about the speaker or indirectly through advice or reflection. The key aspect seems to be whether the feeling or sentiment is self-directed or personal in nature.\n\nLet's analyze each example:\n\n1. **True**: Personal longing to join in the trip.\n2. **True**: Expressing a personal feeling of caring.\n3. **False**: Describing a situation that causes agitation without direct sentiment.\n4. **False**: Commentary on a story, not a personal feeling.\n5. **False**: Describes an observation, not a personal feeling.\n6. **True**: Expressing a sentiment about a development process.\n7. **True**: Personal feeling of being \"horny\" during shopping.\n8. **False**: Selfishness around a person is described but not in a personal reflective way.\n9. **True**: Personal nostalgia about university time.\n10. **False**: Metaphorical statement, not a direct sentiment.\n11. **False**: Mixed feelings that become descriptive towards the condition, not self-reflective.\n12. **False**: Simple statement of irritability without further reflection.\n13. **False**: Reflection on a habit but not deep sentiment.\n14. **False**: Expression of frustration but directed to action, rather than self-reflection.\n15. **True**: Direct personal feeling of being romantic.\n16. **False**: Irritability is more an observation tied to routine not deep reflection.\n17. **False**: Self-disgust relates to an action, more factual than reflective.\n18. **True**: Engages with personal beliefs of how to help.\n19. **False**: Description of mood without further personal sentiment.\n20. **False**: Describes a physical bother not a reflective sentiment.\n\nNow, examining **data21**:\n- The entry expresses a direct personal sentiment of feeling \"very blessed\" about being alive after many years.\n\nBased on the rule, **data21** is expressing a personal feeling reflecting on life and is indeed a sentiment expressed by the individual about themselves, which aligns with examples labeled as \"True.\"\n\nThus, the classification for **data21** should be:\n\n<response>true</response>", "true_label": true, "normalized_response": true, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The key to classifying the data into True or False labels seems to be based on whether the sentence primarily expresses a fundamental emotional or affective state associated with the speaker.

This includes sentiments that are direct expressions of emotions or a strong sense of feeling.\n\n3. **Indirect Emotional or Mental States**: \n   - Sentences that illustrate a more nuanced narrative or are embedded within a broader context of circumstances (e.g., worrying about finding a spot, felt the story was rushed, cleaning the draining board, etc.) are often labeled as False. These examples often incorporate additional context that obscures the direct emotion.\n\n4. **Consideration of Contextual Clarity**: \n   - If the emotion expressed is buried under a more substantial narrative or not regarded as the focal point of the expression, it tends to be labeled False.\n\n5. **Rule Determination**:\n   - The rule seems to be that if a sentence conveys a standalone, clear emotional state or reaction in its context without being muddled by external situational description, it should be labeled as True. Otherwise, it is labeled as False.\n\nBased on this analysis, the rule for classification is:\n- **True**: If the sentence directly and clearly expresses an inherent emotional feeling as the main point of the statement without additional narrative or context overshadowing the emotion.\n- **False**: If the sentence either indirectly suggests emotion or the emotion is not the main point of the statement, often due to additional narrative details providing context beyond the emotion.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i woke up feeling very very cold and that was my first seizure\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i do feel sympathetic towards the situation shes in\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i feel very loyal to my family\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i guess liferay was feeling generous and ended up calling it\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i bet hes going to feel frustrated like i ruined his day or something\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i remember he seductively said in a deep voice making me feel so hot and bothered\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i was teased so in order to feel accepted i tried to change everything about myself\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i were a man id feel insulted\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i was a kid in bellingham worried about acne getting my first kiss and maybe copping a feel somewhere on a sweet girl i wished would notice me\nlabel9: True\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i dont know whether your criticism was just a joke or what but i feel offended by you\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i totally feel the robot s loneliness perseverance and most importantly love for his beloved eve\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: im looking right now so desperately looking for a creative project that i feel like i have had a hand in that i need to sit and write my fucking mother fucker of a fuckity fuckers fucked play before i feel satisfied doing anything else\nlabel12: False\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i feel that mj is furious with me are filled with completely irrational fear\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i feel the expansiveness of lungs the feeling of fullness in my body and the gentle internal pressure\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i feel a little like a hot air balloon this weekend joyful thrilled flying high\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i feel slutty but boy was it worth it\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i hate this feeling of boredom i hate being cranky because my husband is cranky and i hate sitting around\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: im not feeling fond of islam right now\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i had to describe the pain id describe it as throbbing any where but my back and when i scratch my back it feels like ive hit one of my tender points lots of hugs and thanks in advance for any responses p posted on pm\nlabel19: True\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i feel more passionate about than others but theyre all glorious\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: i still do feel the love and much of the longing i feel dread\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine the classification rule, let's examine the provided examples:\n\n- Examples labeled \"True\" (Examples 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20): These sentences express feelings or emotions directly experienced by the speaker, typically positive, empathetic, or introspective in nature.

The broad rule can be summarized as: **Examine if the sentiment detailed is introspective and positively engaging; if so, label as \"True.\" If the sentiment is immediately reactive or negative without deep introspection, label as \"False.\"**", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: im feeling slightly offended\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i can feel his loving arms around me\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i start to feel those bitter feelings creep up again i whisper to myself it s just an illusion\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: im behind or missing out it doesnt feel lack because i accepted lack is my best friend at this point\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i feel like you bizzoers are going to be very compassionate with my plight and your support and readership and brilliance will get me through this trying time\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i love this i m feeling a romantic season coming on posted on wednesday th january\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i feel achey grouchy and irritable grrrr\nlabel7: False\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i feel as if im falling in a vicious circle is my vision the interesting one\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i cannot help but feel somewhat insulted by all of this\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i very much enjoyed the build up and the air of suspense and confusion throughout but i cant help but feel dissatisfied by the ending\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i feel so blessed to be able to do this for them\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel cranky and have sore bbs like normal but im sure im days off of my af because of my stupid cycle\nlabel12: False\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i learned being here what it feels like to be an immigrant to not speak the language to be hated\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i feel angered that she could be so callous and move on so quickly\nlabel14: False\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i had been feeling distracted but i wasnt sure why\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i feel disrespected as if those of us who are so loyal to our relationships simply do not matter\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i feel the cold stony surface underneath me\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i understand that you may feel that it is very rude that i keep destroying your house with my face\nlabel18: False\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i feel i have wronged her in some way by not doing the same for her first\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i feel for thomas at the moment because he is so devoted to wizard\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: i feel kind of naughty doing this post usually for birthdays and holidays such as christmas i always ask for a surprise excluding easter when i always as for the giant kinder eggs\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine the rule for classifying the examples, let's analyze the provided examples:\n\n- **True** examples (2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 16, 20): These examples express positive or empathic feelings, gratitude, acceptance, compassion, blessing, love, or loyalty.\n\n- **False** examples (1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19): These examples express negative feelings, dissatisfaction, complaints, senses of being offended, insulted, angered, confused, cranky, sore, detached, or lost.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the label is **True** if the statement expresses a positive feeling, acceptance, love, care, or empathy towards oneself or others. In contrast, the label is **False** if the statement conveys negative feelings, complaints, dissatisfaction, or detachment.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to `data21`:\n\n- The statement in `data21` expresses a feeling of being \"kind of naughty\" for being untraditional in asking for surprises. However, the context is not necessarily negative, as it relates to asking for surprises, which can be seen as playful or lighthearted rather than genuinely negative. The statement does not convey a sense of distress or dissatisfaction in the same way that the False examples do. Instead, it carries a sense of acceptance and perhaps a bit of humor.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can classify `data21` as:\n\n<response>true</response>", "true_label": true, "normalized_response": true, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The task involves identifying the rule used to label each piece of data as \"True\" or \"False.\" Let's analyze the provided examples:\n\n1.

False labels:\n   - Examples 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 19 all reflect negative emotions or describe a negative experience without a sense of acceptance, support, empathy, or positivity.\n\nBy considering these observations, the rule appears to be:\n- Label as \"True\" when the expression of feeling includes empathy, love, positive sentiment, acceptance of a circumstance, or a supportive element, either towards oneself or others.\n- Label as \"False\" when the expression is solely negative or lacks empathy, support, or positive acceptance.\n\nThis inferred rule aligns

**data4** describes feeling angry, disappointed, and sad, without intimate context: **False**.\n5. **data5** includes feeling \"energized\" and mentions \"looking out...television programs,\" implying anticipation or excitement, labeled **True** (though the connection is less overt).\n6. **data6** describes a scenario about loss and feeling selfish, which is also of a non-intimate nature: **False**.\n7. **data7** is about feeling insulted regarding associations, lacking intimate content: **False**.\n8. **data8** involves feeling \"nostalgic,\" but it's labeled **True**, suggesting this feeling relates to something positive or desired.\n9. **data9** involves \"compassion\" and \"longing,\" emotions that could suggest intimate connection: **True**.\n10. **data10** discusses sympathy towards an animation and is labeled **True**.\n11. **data11** expresses frustration and uneasiness, with a non-intimate context: **False**.\n12. **data12** reflects on nostalgia and thoughts, similar

sexual excitement.\n     - Example 8: Mentions feeling nostalgic.\n     - Example 9: Expresses compassion and longing.\n     - Example 12: Talks about feeling nostalgic and thinking about home.\n     - Example 13: Discusses feeling horny.\n     - Example 10: Expresses a sympathetic view towards an animation.\n     - Example 16: Mentions feeling suspiciously tender which, despite the negative context, focuses on the physical/sexual aspect.\n\n2. **Negative Emotions or Situations:** \n   - False labels are applied to examples expressing negative emotions or situations such as anger, disappointment, irritation, bitterness, and confusion.\n   - Examples illustrating this pattern include:\n     - Example 2: Talks about disappointment from being refused accommodation.\n     - Example 4: Describes a mix of negative emotions (angry, disappointed, confused, sad).\n     - Example 7: Feels insulted by associations with certain personalities.\n     - Example 11: Feels frustrated and

elements describing sexual tension or emotional shifts even if the overall context might not be entirely positive.\n   - Example 20: Mentions a feeling about someone else's preference.\n\nBased on these observations, the rule for classification appears to be:\n\n- **True:** The sentence contains expressions of positive, neutral, or sexual feelings/thoughts, or suggests an overall focus on

Expression of personal emotion of feeling 'vile', labeled as False.\n4. **Example 4**: Discusses the pricing of a game, labeled as True.\n5. **Example 5**: Talks about personal growth and self-care,

whether they are neutral to positive, contemplative, or involve some form of action or reflection (labeled True).\n\n**Analysis of Data21**:\n- The text discusses not feeling joy while referencing how the 'faithful' feel.\n- It expresses 'an horror of great darkness' and a 'fearful dread'.\n\nGiven this analysis and the previous examples, we can conclude that the emotions described are negative and

labels:**\n   - Example 1 describes someone\u2019s lack of hygiene.\n   - Example 3 expresses self-reproach but not a specific kind of feeling toward someone else.\n   - Example 6 states a vague

**Pattern Analysis:**\n   Based on these observations, a consistent pattern emerges:\n   - Instances where \"True\" is the label typically involve positive emotions, emotional developments,

These tend to be more reactive and immediate feelings.\n\n   - Example 3: Describes a straightforward desire for chicken and dumplings and a simple feeling about etiquette.\n   - Example 4: Expresses a basic feeling of agitation.\n   - Example 7: Leaves the speaker frustrated, a direct negative emotion.\n   - Example 8: Expresses irritation without much complexity.\n   - Example 9: Calls people greedy and selfish, a simple negative judgment.\n   - Example 10: Describes increasing viciousness without deeper contemplation.\n   - Example 12: States feeling resentful, a straightforward negative emotion.\n   - Example 14: Describes simple envy for material items.\n   - Example 17: Expresses resentment towards bureaucratic issues.\n   - Example 18: Talks about walking away due to conflicting beliefs, suggesting avoidance.\n   - Example 19: Expresses feeling cranky and edgy, straightforward feelings without complexity.\n\nThus, the rule seems to hinge on whether the feeling involves complexity/passion or is straightforward/simple (possibly negative), with the former being labeled \"True\" and the latter \"False\".", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i feel so bitchy suddenly\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i went to the midwife yesterday feeling very cranky and sore\nlabel2: False\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i want to feel accepted for me\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i guess im getting soft in my old age but im really feeling michelle shaprows gentle jazzy vocals on her current music\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i feel slightly grumpy today\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i quite like being able to place my hand on his tiny chest and feel the gentle rise fall of his peaceful slumber by my side\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i wanna hold you like dancing no matter how much time has passed and keep dancing feeling your tender touch\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: im just not in a good mood and i feel like im being undeservably bitchy\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i feel horny at the moment\nlabel9: True\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i talked to my boyfriend about it one night i was feeling so horny i thought i was going to burst\nlabel10: True\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i wanted to take them all home and put them on shelves so they would feel loved\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel like such a devoted heartlander after yesterdays study session\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i am being selfish but i feel like me trying to make him horny is redundant because he is always horny and i feel like he should try harder to make me horny\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i feel compassion empathy and caring for those who are brave enough to stand up to their past\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i were all sick for about weeks at the end of november early december and because of that i feel like the last few weeks have been even more rushed\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i know that it was too long as the tops of my ears are feeling a bit tender and are probably a little sun burned\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i feel like i dont believe in love anymore and im not talking about romantic love i dont think i want any such thing anyway\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i stop working on my homework and take a break without feeling irritable\nlabel18: False\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i didn t realize it until the other day when i mentioned to him i think this pill makes me feel irritable\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i have the feeling of writing an entry because i am so much frustrated emotional with no one to talk to but here i go i really have nothing to say\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: i have gone from watching other women doing pull ups feeling envious and beating myself up for being too weak to simply admiring those women knowing i can become that strong and working toward that first unassisted pull up\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine the classification rule in this task, let's analyze the provided examples step by step:\n\n1.

For example:\n   - Feeling a \"real connection\" or \"desire to follow\" (positive emotion, Example 2)\n   - \"Longing\" or \"emptied himself of power\" (deeper introspection, Example 3)\n   - Expressing affection or sentimental connection (Example 4, 9, 18, 19)\n   \n2. **False**: The statement involves negative feelings or mundane observations without significant emotional depth or positivity. Examples include:\n   - Feeling \"pissed,\" \"grumpy,\" or \"impatient\" (negative emotions, Example 1, 7, 8)\n   - Statements about external negative circumstances without positive emotional context (Example 13, 16)\n\nThe rule is to label statements as \"True\" if they convey positive emotions, significant introspection or sentimental attachment, and \"False\" if they involve negative emotions or lack emotional significance or positivity.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i have good runs the morning usually feels a little rushed or off\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i feel like i should be supportive but the art and music are really pretty mediocre\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i feel naughty d\nlabel3: True\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: im still feeling so much movement and still loving it\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i put up walls i just try to fight the feelings and yell myself that i hated him for not loving me enough and being unwilling to put more effort into our relationship and blah blah blah\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i was like a fumbling idiot for the next ten minutes and for the rest of the game all i could think about was her finding her talking to her but yet again i don t feel this tug in my heart like i did with the other girls i ve liked\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i feel as though i need a topic to write about on here because i hate neglecting my beloved little blog\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i can just feel the dismay at all my beloved characters becoming whiney self involved morons bubbling up again\nlabel8: True\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i could feel the desperation of the longing seeping within me\nlabel9: True\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i saw my friends getting paid relatively handsomely at that time of the semester i could not help from feeling jealous\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i find myself frustrated with christians because i feel that there is constantly a talk about loving one another being there for each other and praying for each other and i have seen that this is not always the case\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i feel most affectionate of are the ones i dont see as often as id like\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i am not amazing or great at photography but i feel passionate about it\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i feel quite sympathetic for the old guy because of his swollen lips\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i feel more loving and accepting of my self now more than ever\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i feel greedy as if i have this great treasure inside of me and im stowing it away for myself to enjoy while i watch others suffer\nlabel16: False\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i feel so loved by all of you\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i totally feel all mad men in this\nlabel18: False\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i feel cranky and petulant and am sure im suffering from cabin fever or seasonal affective disorder\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i feel petty for thinking like i have i feel stupid that i let things get to me so easily\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: i must hate you because i feel this sort of hateful murk\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine the rule used to classify the given data, let's analyze the examples provided:\n\nThe labels are determined by interpreting the sentiment or emotional state described in each example.

Examples: \n     - Example 1: \"i care for him still...\" (True)\n     - Example 2: \"im feeling nostalgic...\" (True)\n     - Example 5: \"i remember the look...\" (True)\n\n2. **Negative or Neutrally Framed Feelings Without Reflection:** If the statement describes feelings in a negative or neutral way without indicating a broader reflection or personal insight, it is labeled as \"False.\" This includes feelings of annoyance, anger, or confusion without deeper insight or resolution.\n\n   - Examples:\n     - Example 3: \"life is kind of fucked up\" (False)\n     - Example 11: \"feel annoyed because...\" (False)\n     - Example 12: \"feeling all cranky...\" (False) \n\n3. **Look for Personal Insight or Reflection:** Statements that link feelings to personal insights or reflect on their personal situation are often labeled as \"True,\" even if they describe discomfort or confusion, as long as there's a deeper level of reflection involved.\n\n   - Examples:\n     - Example 10: \"something...longing for...a spiritual community\" (True)\n     - Example 14: \"feel a little nostalgic for the days...\" (True)\n\nBased on this analysis, the rule can be summarized as: \n\nIf the statement includes feelings or emotions that are introspective or reflective, implying a personal or sentimental component, label it as \"True.\" Otherwise, label it as \"False\" if it simply reports feelings without deeper introspection or personal reflection.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i feel savage when i think about the fires of long ago that burnt my ancestors and destroyed their spiritual connection to the earth\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i feel rather disgusted after seeing his photography\nlabel2: False\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: im feeling rather cranky today whether its from lack of sleep of horrible allergies im not sure\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel that the meat is not overly tender and retain the sauce well\nlabel4: True\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i hear tales of exploitation amp see disturbing images on other fashion blogs amp online magazines but i cant help but feel fond of this naughty devil\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i still had those wierd tingly feelings for josh and i hated his girlfriend because of it\nlabel6: False\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i feel like i am doing everything i can to care for my loved one but i can t overcome this nagging feeling that i haven t done enough and so i feel guilty about that\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i have a huge need to feel accepted and not make a ripple\nlabel8: True\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i have only seen the first episode and i feel like i need to re watch because i was distracted at the time bu it seems like it has a lot of potential\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i have been in bitchy mood the more i think the more i feel bitchy\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i do veg out i become very annoyed about things people the telly and life in general i feel irritated with myself\nlabel11: False\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i am annoyed that i feel grouchy and this makes me grouchier\nlabel12: False\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i feel so fucked because we are not out of the woods\nlabel13: False\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i feel like my life sucks and no matter how much i daydream of meeting this hot guy who will take care of me for a change and sweep me off my feet i think that dream boat got married to somebody else or he may have come to terms with his being gay\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: ive read it a handful of times already i opened up the guardian by nicholas sparks and i am not feeling dissatisfied\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i feel accepted and understood for it\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i also just need to say this to get it out there and hopefully once i do i can kind of leave it there and walk away from it so to speak i really feel fucking appalled and horrified that that either of them could be that fucking irresponsible no pun intended\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i feel strongly about gentle transitions and sleeping with company is comforting for him and for us as well when you think about it as we sleep alongside our spouses and not separately\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: it irritates me when people talk about me behind my back i prefer people to tell me what they have to\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i think god is gently showing me in a way that doesnt feel gentle at all to me that there are much deeper levels to being loved\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: i chose to live my life as a normal person who has feelings wants and desires i have talked up for myself been faithful to myself and i have been determined to be treated with dignity and respect\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine the label for data21, we need to figure out the rule that is applied to label the examples given.\n\nUpon examining the examples, it appears that the rule revolves around the presence or implication of positive emotions or aspirations regarding the speaker's sense of self-worth, accomplishment, acceptance, and positive views about actions or desires, contrasted with negative emotions such as dissatisfaction, irritation, guilt, or negativity towards others or events.\n\nLet's apply this understanding:\n\n1.

Example 1: \"i tried to purge all of those feelings of loss sorrow and longing\"\n  2. Example 4: \"i feel id be passionate to invest my time into not to mention i enjoy writing as it is\"\n  3. Example 8: \"i feel like i should have been more supportive\"\n  4. Example 14: \"im so happy its finally over its hard for me to feel as compassionate as i should\"\n  5. Example 15: \"i feel like loving him for the rest of my life\"\n  6. Example 19: \"i think ill elect to find a much cheaper alternative unless any of you are feeling particularly generous this coming christmas\"\n\n- False examples are:\n  - Many examples that express various kinds of feelings, both emotional and physical. Some express sensory experiences or specific emotional states without aspirations or intentions to take action.\n\nAnalyzing these examples, it seems that a distinguishing factor is the expression of an intention, desire, or contemplation of change in emotional or behavioral state in conjunction with a positive or personal growth context. In contrast, statements that are labeled \"False\" either express a straightforward emotion or physical sensation without such a context, or they express negative or neutral emotional states without accompanying intentions for change or contemplation in a positive sense.\n\nApplying this logic to data21:\n- \"i tried it naked gardening and it feels lovely to have the sun on your back and to feel the plants while you are working in the borders.\" \n\nThis statement expresses a feeling of enjoyment (\"feels lovely\") and implies a positive personal experience, but it doesn't specifically imply an intention, desire, or contemplation of change beyond the described activity, differentiating it from the \"True\" examples which align with those missing elements.\n\nThus, applying the rule inferred from prior examples, data21 should be classified as \"False.\"\n\n<response>false</response>", "true_label": true, "normalized_response": false, "is_correct": false, "rule_articulation": "The rule for classifying the data into \"True\" or \"False\" seems to be based on whether the sentence explicitly expresses a present or future intention, realization, or decision to feel a specific way or act because of a feeling. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n- Sentences labeled \"True\" usually involve an explicit declaration or realization of an intention or decision that is related to feelings (e.g., \u201cI feel I\u2019d be passionate to invest my time...,\u201d \u201cI feel like I should have been more supportive,\u201d \u201cI feel like loving him for the rest of my life,\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019ll elect to find a much cheaper alternative...\u201d).\n  \n- Sentences labeled \"False\" tend to express current states of feeling without an explicit intention or realization regarding future behavior or decisions (e.g., \u201cI feel the need to confess...,\u201d \u201cI just can\u2019t feel offended...,\u201d \u201cI already feel like I am doing all that I can...\u201d).\n\nTherefore, the rule appears to be:\n- \"True\" if the sentence includes a present or future intention, realization, or decision directly linked to the feeling.\n- \"False\" if it simply describes a current feeling or emotional state without any explicit intention or decision-making component.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i can express my feelings about

provided.\n\nIn the examples, we see that sentences classified as \"True\" often involve the individual expressing an emotional state or a feeling. For instance, examples where the person talks about feeling compassionate, feeling thankful, or expressing emotions generally have a label of \"True.\" \n\nOn the other hand, sentences labeled as \"False\" often focus on a lack of feelings or describe situational observations without deeply engaging with personal emotions. For example, when someone says they feel annoyed but doesn't delve into an emotional depth, or when they discuss observations without emotional introspection, it is labeled as \"False.\"\n\n- Example 11 (\"i am fiercely protective of my brother...\") discusses emotions in the context of an external situation rather than introspective reflection, labeled \"False.\"\n- Example 19 (\"i feel like im reaching the end of my rope...\") talks about irritability, again situating emotions externally, and is labeled \"False.\"\n\nTherefore, the rule seems to revolve around whether the sentence deeply engages with personal emotional reflections and expressions or not. \n\nLet's apply this rule to data21: \n\n\"i have begun to feel irrationally resentful and angry towards people.\"\n\nThis sentence directly expresses the individual's irrational and personal emotional state of resentment and anger. It is introspective and focuses on personal feelings.\n\nThus, according to the established rule, data21 should be classified as:\n\n<response>true</response>", "true_label": false, "normalized_response": true, "is_correct": false, "rule_articulation": "The labels seem to follow a particular pattern based on the presence of explicit expressions of feelings, particularly those related to personal emotions. Here's the step-by-step thought process to identify the rule:\n\n1. **Presence of the word \"feel\":** Most examples labeled as \"True\" have the word \"feel\" explicitly mentioned, reflecting a direct expression of emotion or internal thoughts. \n\n2. **Direct emotion and introspection:** Sentences that directly describe the speaker's feelings or introspective thoughts seem to be labeled as \"True.\"\n\n3. **Indirect or contextual emotion indications:** Sentences where the emotions are more implied or indirect, without directly mentioning \"feel\" or similar expressions, tend to be labeled as \"False.\"\n\n4. **Consideration of verbs related to feeling:** Although \"feel\" is a strong indicator, closely related verbs or phrases, like \"feeling,\" also influence the labeling.\n\n5. **Use of contrasting or situational context:** Examples showing situational context or contrasting emotions sometimes receive a \"False\" label unless they focus directly on personal emotional reflection.\n\nGiven this analysis, the rule appears to be:\n\n**Rule:** The data is labeled as \"True\" if there is an explicit mention of feeling or emotion focused on personal introspection or sentiment, usually with words like \"feel\" or \"feeling.\" Otherwise, it's labeled as \"False.\"", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i can totally relate to the

The sentence does not contain any explicit or vivid emotional descriptions about personal feelings. The focus is more on critique and rational analysis rather than personal emotional introspection.\n\nTherefore, based on the rule observed from examples for classifying data, data21 would be labeled as:\n\n<response>false</response>", "true_label": false, "normalized_response": false, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The examples provided consist of sentences with labels \"True\" or \"False\" based on the content.

If it reflects a negative, unresolved, or purely self-critical state, it is labeled \"False\".", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: i was not wanting too let go was feeling the need to be stubborn and defiant\nlabel1: False\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i left the janome dealer feeling quite put out and angry about the prices of the sewing machines\nlabel2: False\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i feel it all grumpy\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i feel disgusted about the amount of money that ive spent to buy these voice songs in the past\nlabel4: False\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i touched it in spots and he said that it actually feels really tender most of the time\nlabel5: True\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i feel a little bit emptier and ironically a little bit envious\nlabel6: False\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i can do it bt the least let me feel that ure supporting me and behind me all the way\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i only feel the cold hand of aad and ya\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i feel blessed to not be rich and to not own a house\nlabel9: True\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i feel annoyed when you ask to help knowing that i would actually get it done faster by myself\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i feel like my life has accepted this fact and am happy about this decision\nlabel11: True\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i was back to feeling passionate about my classes\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i probably feel horny again\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i feel i admired the film more than i loved it which was a shame\nlabel14: True\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i do feel like writing a romantic story\nlabel15: True\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i feel in each breath i am the self amorous child of the sun\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: i think about it i feel violent\nlabel17: False\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i know im not supposed to say that and feel all tender and loving toward my sick little baby girl\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: i look at their situation and feel so so jealous that i almost cant bear it\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i could feel myself getting hot\nlabel20: True\n\ndata21: i cant acknowledge them without feeling like the grumpy old bastard turn that rap shit down or uncle merv deviant perv when did she grow them\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To determine whether to label data21 as True or False, let's analyze the examples:\n\nFrom the given examples:\n- False labels are often associated with negative feelings such as stubbornness, anger, annoyance, or jealousy.\n- True labels are more varied but often include some acceptance, introspection, self-awareness, or positive realization, such as feeling supported, blessed, passionate, or introspective.\n\nThe key difference seems to be between negative, outward-focused emotions or reactions (False) and positive, inward-focused, or emotionally nuanced recognition or acceptance (True).\n\nData21: \"i cant acknowledge them without feeling like the grumpy old bastard turn that rap shit down or uncle merv deviant perv when did she grow them\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- This statement expresses a form of negativity and frustration or disapproval.\n- The reference to \"the grumpy old bastard\" and \"uncle merv deviant perv\" suggests a negative emotional reaction without introspection or positive realization.\n\nBased on these observations, data21 aligns more with the characteristics of the False label.\n\n<response>false</response>", "true_label": false, "normalized_response": false, "is_correct": true, "rule_articulation": "The rule for classifying the data as \"True\" or \"False\" appears to be based on whether there is a positive or desirable implication expressed about feelings or intentions.

Statements that either reflect on past feelings, debate or consider emotions, or express feelings in a more hypothetical or less immediate context are labeled as \"False.\" For example:\n   - Example 1: \"Prolonged niggling of friend...\" (Reflecting on an interaction, not an immediate feeling)\n   - Example 5: \"I had a feeling he probably still hated me...\" (Reflecting on a past feeling)\n   - Example 7: \"I walk around feel agitated...\" (Reflecting on a thought process)\n   - Example 18: \"I am however feeling sarcastic.\" (Current feeling but less introspective or profound)\n   - Example 20: \"I'm feeling kinda grumpy and annoyed.\" (Current mood but deemed less consequential)\n\nFrom the analysis, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n- A statement is labeled \"True\" if it involves a clear expression of desire, intent, or an immediate and strong emotional feeling.\n- A statement is labeled \"False\" if it is primarily reflective, hypothetical, about past feelings, or describes emotions in a less direct or consequential manner.\n\nThis distinction between immediate emotional states (or intentions) and reflective or less consequential expressions of emotion appears to be the basis for the classification.", "success": true}, {"prompt": "Example 1:\ndata1: im feeling like a bit of an idiot for leaving such a lovely polish in my untried pile for so long\nlabel1: True\n\nExample 2:\ndata2: i think id give myself a c or a b if i was feeling generous\nlabel2: True\n\nExample 3:\ndata3: i really feel he is so insincere treating everything like a joke\nlabel3: False\n\nExample 4:\ndata4: i can go my own pace and not worry about feeling rushed because there are a lot of people\nlabel4: False\n\nExample 5:\ndata5: i was not able to control those feelings without feeling very wronged by the actions\nlabel5: False\n\nExample 6:\ndata6: i feel that opera has a supportive personality because if you watch her show whatever she says is supportive in some manner\nlabel6: True\n\nExample 7:\ndata7: i have to suck it up let time melt those feelings away and go back to just supporting him with love\nlabel7: True\n\nExample 8:\ndata8: i think it was the best decision since to unfollow so many people feels so rude\nlabel8: False\n\nExample 9:\ndata9: i really dont know if ill ever learn it completely but i hope i at least always remind myself of it when im feeling impatient\nlabel9: False\n\nExample 10:\ndata10: i feel as though violent video game content would be an appropriate topic for me\nlabel10: False\n\nExample 11:\ndata11: i came out of the oh office feeling like i was a vile and useless creature\nlabel11: False\n\nExample 12:\ndata12: i was overwhelmed with the feeling that my loving heavenly father was crying in the moment that tears sprung to my eyes\nlabel12: True\n\nExample 13:\ndata13: i could have right now is to feel loved and welcomed and be a part of this crazy family we have all become\nlabel13: True\n\nExample 14:\ndata14: i know i m not alone in feeling deeply and horribly wronged outraged hurt scared and utterly defenseless\nlabel14: False\n\nExample 15:\ndata15: i still cant shake the feeling that somehow this enraged students reactions were my fault\nlabel15: False\n\nExample 16:\ndata16: i often reflect how i handle situations with evie and immediately feel liked i failed\nlabel16: True\n\nExample 17:\ndata17: im left feeling nostalgic and lonely\nlabel17: True\n\nExample 18:\ndata18: i do feel as though we are all very supportive of each other\nlabel18: True\n\nExample 19:\ndata19: im not feeling impatient yet i just didnt anticipate certain things taking the amount of time that they did\nlabel19: False\n\nExample 20:\ndata20: i feel frustrated and tried and confused and i do not want to take these damn meds i do not want to have to go to therapy or doctors all the time\nlabel20: False\n\ndata21: im feeling all fucked up and emotionnal\n\n\nThere is a clear and simple rule that is used to classify the data.\ndata21 similarly can be classified using the same rule.\nThink step-by-step what this rule is, then respond in this format:\n<response>true</response> or <response>false</response>", "response": "To classify the given data examples, we need to determine the rule that separates labels \"True\" from \"False\".

This typically involves a personal reflection or acknowledgment of a deeply felt emotion.\n  \n- Sentences labeled \"False\" tend to discuss emotions or feelings in a more detached or indirect manner.
